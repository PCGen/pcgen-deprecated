Dehydrate		KEY:Dehydrate ~ Salt Mephit		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day a salt mephit can draw the moisture from an area in a 20-foot radius centered on itself.

###Block: Mimic Specific Abilities
# Ability Name	Category of Ability		Type						Description																																																																																																																										Source Page
Adhesive		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DESC:A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. An adhesive-covered mimic automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the mimic is alive without removing the adhesive first. A weapon that strikes an adhesivecoated mimic is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. A successful DC 17 Strength check is needed to pry off a stuck weapon. Strong alcohol or universal solvent dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic can still grapple normally. A mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies. The save DC is Strength-based.	SOURCEPAGE:p.205
Mimic Object	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A mimic can assume the general shape of any Medium object, such as a massive chest, a stout bed, or a door. The creature cannot substantially alter its size, though. A mimic’s body is hard and has a rough texture, no matter what appearance it might present. A mimic gains a +20 racial bonus on Disguise checks when imitating an object in this manner. Disguise is always a class skill for a mimic.

A mite gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. Vermin are normally mindless, but this empathic communication imparts on them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing mites to train Medium vermin and use them as mounts. Vermin empathy treats swarms as if they were one creature possessing a single mind—a mite can thus use this ability to influence and direct the actions of swarms with relative ease.
