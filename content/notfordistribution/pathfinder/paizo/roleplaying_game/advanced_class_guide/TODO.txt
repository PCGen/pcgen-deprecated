Barbarian Rage Powers on page 80
Skald rage powers should be limited to only those powers that DO NOT require a standard action or rounds of rage to activate

Ability: Earth Blessing ~ Armor of Earth should have BONUS to DR, but not stack with any other DR.

Ability: Glory Blessing ~ Demoralizing Glory "ranks in Intimidate" instead of "warpriest level"? So recalculate the the DC by Intimidate skill, subtract ranks and any bonus due to ranks and recalcuate using level in place of ranks
