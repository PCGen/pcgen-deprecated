Many practitioners of this bloodline go on to lead powerful kobold tribes.  As a standard action, you can sketch a single, nearly invisible magical rune on any 5-foot-square solid surface. When you create a rune, pick one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire.  While the rune is active, the next creature other than you who steps on or touches the rune's area causes the rune to explode. The rune's explosion deals a number of points of energy damage equal to 1d81 to anything in its square. A Reflex saving throw halves the damage (DC %1 The rune is considered a magical trap for the purpose of perceiving it or disabling it) The DC for both Perception and Disable Device checks is the same as the Reflex saving throw to halve the damage. You can use this ability %2 times per day.  Each rune lasts for 24 hours or until discharged. As a swift action, you may spend 1 point from your arcane pool to increase potency of any runes scribed for %3 rounds.

You can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, you gain a +%2 morale bonus to your Strength and a +%3 morale bonus to your Constitution, as well as a +%4 morale bonus on Will saving throws. In addition, you take a %5 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants you %6 hit points, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in bloodrage, you cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. You can end your bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, you are fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. You cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but otherwise can enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If you fall unconscious, your bloodrage immediately ends, placing you in peril of death.

This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack). Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual power more than once.

Spell Kenning		KEY:Skald ~ Spell Kenning			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkaldClassAbility.SkaldSpellKenning.Supernatural																						DESC:At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes' spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald's spells known, expending a skald spell slot of an appropriate level to cast the spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell. At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.
Lore Master			KEY:Skald ~ Lore Master				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkaldClassAbility.SkaldLoreMaster.Extraordinary																						DESC:At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action. He can use this ability one additional time per day for every six levels he possesses beyond 5th, to a maximum of three times per day at 17th level.
Damage Reduction		KEY:Skald ~ Damage Reduction			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkaldClassAbility.SkaldDamageReduction.Extraordinary																					DESC:At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th level this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0. The skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his raging song.
Dirge of Doom		KEY:Skald ~ Dirge of Doom			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkaldClassAbility.SkaldDirgeOfDoom.Supernatural																						DESC:At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This works like raging song and expends rounds of raging song, but it only affects enemies within 30 feet who are able to hear the skald's performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and it relies on audible components. A skald may not use dirge of doom and raging song simultaneously.
Master Skald		KEY:Skald ~ Master Skald			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkaldClassAbility.SkaldMasterSkald.Supernatural																						DESC:At 20th level, a skald's raging song no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills, abilities, or rage powers they can use.
