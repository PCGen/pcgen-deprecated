A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.													
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Brawler ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BrawlerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality		DESC:A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group.

A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and use a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing medium or heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components. A multiclass skald still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.

The ability must be one gained at 1stlevel and is limited in its use to %1 times per day. As a swift action, youcan expend one point from your arcane reservoir to bolster your understanding,allowing you to treat your arcanist level as your wizard level for theseabilities for %2 rounds.

You can bloodrage for %1 rounds per day.  The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive. You can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, you gain a +%2 morale bonus to your Strength and a +%3 morale bonus to your Constitution, as well as a +%4 morale bonus on Will saving throws. In addition, you take a %5 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants you %6 hit points, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in bloodrage, you cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. You can end your bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, you are fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. You cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but otherwise can enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If you fall unconscious, your bloodrage immediately ends, placing you in peril of death. Bloodrage counts as the barbarian's rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.|RageDuration|RageStrBonus|RageConBonus|RageSaveBonus|RageACPenalty|(RageConBonus/2)*TL	BENEFIT:When you enter a bloodrage, you can apply on yourself the effects a bloodrager spell you know of 2nd level or lower.|PREVAREQ:BloodrageStage,1	BENEFIT:When you enter a bloodrage, you can apply on yourself the effects a bloodrager spell you know.|PREVAREQ:BloodrageStage,2	BENEFIT:The spell must have a range of touch or personal.

He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to %1. The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice. If a combat feat has a daily use limitation, any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat's daily limit. At later levels, when he gains multiple feats through this ability, the brawler can use those feats to meet the prerequisites of other feats he gains with this ability. Doing so means he cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another's prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward his daily uses of this ability.|BrawlerMartialFlexibilityTimes|PREVAREQ:BrawlerLVL,20
Awesome Blow			KEY:Brawler ~ Awesome Blow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BrawlerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DESC:You can deal a powerful blow that sends an enemy reeling.	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:The brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler's choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can't move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent's move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)
Improved Awesome Blow	KEY:Brawler ~ Improved Awesome Blow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BrawlerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DESC:You have improved your ability to deliver awesome blows.	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:The brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.

She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk's robe).

These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat. Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.

Domain					KEY:Divine Hunter ~ Domain						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HunterClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.HunterTeamworkFeats						DESC:(PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED) At 3rd level, a divine hunter learns to call upon the power of her deity. The divine hunter must select one domain from those available to her deity. She gains the granted powers of this domain, using her hunter level - 2 as her cleric level for determining when the powers are gained and what effects they have. Once she chooses this domain, it cannot be changed. If the divine hunter selects the animal domain, she does not gain a second animal companion upon reaching an effective cleric level of 4th. When the divine hunter would gain that ability, her animal companion instead gains two ability score increases (gaining +1 to two different ability scores or +2 to one ability score). If her animal companion dies or is released, when she gains a new one, it benefits from this ability score increase. In addition, the divine hunter adds the 1st-level domain spell from her domain to her list of spells known. She adds the 2nd-level domain spell at 6th level, the 3rd-level domain spell at 9th level, the 4th-level domain spell at 12th level, the 5th-level domain spell at 15th level, and the 6th-level domain spell at 18th level.

If the hunter is evil (or worships an evil deity), the animal companion gains the fiendish template. If the hunter is neutral and worships a neutral deity, she must choose either the celestial or fiendish template; once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. This ability replaces hunter tactics.	SOURCEPAGE:p.95

#TODO Implement Divine Hunter ~ Domain needs to be worked on. If the hunter selects the Animal domain, the Hunter does not get gain a second animal companion. Instead the existing animal companion gains 2 abilitiy increases! Also 1st domain spells are added to known spells at 3rd level, 2nd level domain spells are added at 6th level, etc until 6th level domain spells added to known spells at 18th level.

Feral Focus				KEY:Feral Hunter ~ Feral Focus					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HunterClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.Supernatural.HunterAnimalFocus.HunterHunterTactics,HunterSpeakWithMaster		DESC:At 1st level, a feral hunter gains a limited ability to change her shape into hybrid animal forms. This functions as the animal focus class feature, except that the hunter always applies the animal aspect to herself, and there is no limit to this ability's duration. She can end this ability as a free action. When a feral hunter uses this ability, her body takes on cosmetic aspects of an animal, such as furry skin, longer nails, elongated teeth, and oddly colored eyes; these changes do not grant her any abilities other than what is stated in the animal focus, and end when she takes on a different aspect or ends the ability. This physical change is a polymorph effect, though the effects of the animal focus are not. This ability replaces the animal focus, hunter tactics, and speak with master class abilities.		SOURCEPAGE:P.96
Precise Summoned Animal	KEY:Feral Hunter ~ Precise Summoned Animal		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HunterClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.Extraordinary.HunterPreciseCompanion											DESC:This functions like the precise companion class ability, except if the hunter chooses Outf lankAPG as a bonus feat, she grants it to all animals she summons with summon nature’s ally. This ability alters precise companion.		ABILITY:Hunter Class Features|AUTOMATIC|Hunter ~ Precise Companion						SOURCEPAGE:P.96
Wild Shape				KEY:Feral Hunter ~ Wild Shape					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HunterClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.Supernatural.HunterBonusTricks.HunterImprovedEmpathicLink.HunterGreaterEmpathicLink.HunterMasterOfTheWild.HunterRaiseAnimalCompanion		DESC:At 4th level, a feral hunter gains the ability to change shape. This ability functions like the druid wild shape ability, except the hunter can take only animal forms (not elemental or plant forms). The hunter’s effective druid level is equal to her class level. This ability replaces the bonus tricks, improved empathic link, greater empathic link, master of the wild, and raise animal companion class abilities.		SOURCEPAGE:P.96
Summon Pack				KEY:Feral Hunter ~ Summon Pack					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HunterClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.HunterTeamworkFeat6.HunterTeamworkFeat9.HunterTeamworkFeat12.HunterTeamworkFeat15.HunterTeamworkFeat18		DESC:Starting at 6th level, whenever a feral hunter casts a summon nature’s ally spell to summon one or more animals, she summons one additional animal of the same type. The summoned creature or creatures must be animals and must be of the same type as the hunter's current aspect or of a similar type (bears for bear aspect, dogs or wolves for wolf aspect, great cats for the tiger aspect, and so on). The additional creature immediately vanishes if the hunter chooses a different aspect or ends his feral focus ability. This ability replaces the teamwork feats gained at 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th levels.		SOURCEPAGE:P.96

Pack Bond				KEY:Packmaster ~ Pack Bond						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HunterClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.Extraordinary.HunterAnimalCompanion			DESC:(NOT IMPLEMENTED) A packmaster can have more than one animal companion, but she must divide her effective druid level between her companions to determine the abilities of each one. For example, a 4th-level packmaster can have one 4th-level animal companion, two 2nd-level companions, one 3rd-level companion and one 1st-level companion, or four 1st-level companions. A packmaster's precise companion, woodland stride, and teamwork feats each apply to only one of her animal companions at a time.	SOURCEPAGE:P.96
Pack Focus				KEY:Packmaster ~ Pack Focus						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HunterClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.Supernatural.HunterAnimalFocus			DESC:(NOT IMPLEMENTED) This ability functions like animal focus, with the following exceptions. A packmaster can apply her animal aspect to only one of her animal companions at a time without it counting against the number of minutes per day she can use that ability. When using animal focus on herself or her other animal companion, the ability counts against her minutes per day as normal. She can have only two animal aspects in effect at a time-one that counts against her minutes per day and one that doesn't - and they can't both target the same companion. Unless both her companions are dead, the hunter can't apply the companion's aspect to herself (and thereby gain the benefit of its unlimited duration). This ability replaces animal focus.	SOURCEPAGE:P.96
Teamwork Feat			KEY:Packmaster ~ Teamwork Feat					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HunterClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.Extraordinary.HunterTeamworkFeat			DESC:At 3rd level or any level at which a packmaster would gain a bonus teamwork feat, she can instead increase the number of her animal companions that gain the benefits of her precise companion, woodland stride, and teamwork feats by 1. The current number of animal companions that can benefit from precise companion is %1. She can select this ability multiple times. This ability alters teamwork feats.|PackmasterPreciseCompanionAnimals		DEFINE:PackmasterPreciseCompanionAnimals|0	BONUS:VAR|PackmasterPreciseCompanionAnimals|1	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Hunter Packmaster Teamwork Ability|1|PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,Hunter=3],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.HunterTeamworkFeat3]	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Hunter Packmaster Teamwork Ability|1|PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,Hunter=6],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.HunterTeamworkFeat6]	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Hunter Packmaster Teamwork Ability|1|PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,Hunter=9],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.HunterTeamworkFeat9]	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Hunter Packmaster Teamwork Ability|1|PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,Hunter=12],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.HunterTeamworkFeat12]	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Hunter Packmaster Teamwork Ability|1|PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,Hunter=15],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.HunterTeamworkFeat15]	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Hunter Packmaster Teamwork Ability|1|PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,Hunter=18],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.HunterTeamworkFeat18]	SOURCEPAGE:P.96
Second Pack Focus		KEY:Packmaster ~ Second Pack Focus				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HunterClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.Supernatural.HunterSecondAnimalFocus				DESC:(NOT IMPLEMENTED) At 8th level, the hunter gains an ability that functions like the second animal focus, but the hunter can either assign each companion one aspect each or assign both aspects to the same companion. The foci on the companions don’t need to be the same, nor do they need to be the same as the one assigned to the packmaster. This ability replaces second animal focus.	SOURCEPAGE:P.96
Master Of The Pack		KEY:Packmaster ~ Master Of The Pack				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HunterClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.Extraordinary.HunterMasterHunter				DESC:At 20th level, a packmaster and her animal companions can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. Each day when a packmaster gains new spells for the day, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself or one of her animal companions for the entire day (if all of her animal companions are dead, she instead chooses two animal foci to be active on herself for the entire day). This focus is in addition to her pack focus class ability. This ability replaces master hunter.	SOURCEPAGE:P.97

Primal Transformation	KEY:Primal Companion Hunter ~ Primal Transformation		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HunterClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.Supernatural.HunterAnimalFocus			DESC:(NOT IMPLEMENTED) At first level, a primal companion hunter can awaken a primal creature from within his animal companion as a swift action. The animal companion gains a pool of evolution points (Advanced Player's Guide 60) that can be used to temporarily give the companion evolutions as if it were an eidolon. A primal companion hunter uses her hunter level to determine the number of evolution points gained, limitations on how often an evolution can be selected, and so on. Whenever she gains a level, she must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until she gains another level. Activating these evolutions on the animal companion is a swift action. A primal companion hunter can use this ability for 1 minute per day per hunter level. This duration need not to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. An animal companion transformed in this way cannot exceed the maximum number of attacks available to the eidolon of a summoner whose class level equals that of the hunter. While transformed in this way, the animal companion’s type changes to magical beast, though the primal companion hunter still treats it as an animal for the purpose of the Handle Animal skill. If a primal companion hunter's animal companion is dead, she can apply these evolutions to herself instead of to her animal companion. Uses of this ability count toward the hunter's maximum daily duration of evolution use. This ability replaces animal focus.	SOURCEPAGE:P.97
Primal Surge			KEY:Primal Companion Hunter ~ Primal Surge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HunterClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.Supernatural.HunterSecondAnimalFocus	DESC:(NOT IMPLEMENTED) At 8th level, once per day as a swift action, a primal companion hunter can touch her animal companion and grant it one evolution that costs up to 4 evolution points. The companion must meet the prerequisites of the selected evolution. Unlike the evolutions from primal transformation, this evolution is not set; it can be changed each time the hunter uses this ability. Using primal surge activates the primal transformation ability on the companion if it isn't already active. This effect lasts until the hunter ends the primal transformation. This does not allow a companion to exceed its maximum number of natural attacks. This ability can grant only one evolution at a time, even if the chosen evolution could be selected multiple times. This ability can grant an evolution that allows additional evolution points to be spent to upgrade that evolution (such as damage reduction or flight), and any points left over can be spent on such upgrades. This ability cannot be used to grant an upgrade to an evolution that the companion already possesses. This ability replaces second animal focus.	SOURCEPAGE:P.97
Primal Master			KEY:Primal Companion Hunter ~ Primal Master				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HunterClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.Supernatural.HunterMasterHunter		DESC:(NOT IMPLEMENTED) At 20th level, a primal companion hunter becomes in tune with his primal nature. He can activate his companion’s primal aspect as a free action. When using primal surge, he can grant his companion two evolutions instead of one (each costing up to 4 evolution points). This ability replaces master hunter.	SOURCEPAGE:P.98

Vermin Companion		KEY:Verminous Hunter ~ Vermin Companion			CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:HunterClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.Extraordinary.HunterAnimalCompanion						DESC:(NOT IMPLEMENTED) At 1st level, a verminous hunter must choose a vermin companion instead of an animal companion (Ultimate Magic 36). This ability alters animal companion. The hunter tactics class ability allows a verminous hunter to grant her teamwork feats to a mindless vermin companion.	SOURCEPAGE:P.98
Vermin Empathy			KEY:Verminous Hunter ~ Vermin Empathy			CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:HunterClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.Extraordinary.HunterWildEmpathy			ABILITY:Hunter Class Features|AUTOMATIC|Hunter ~ Wild Empathy					DESC:A verminous hunter gains the wild empathy ability, but can use it only to influence vermin (not animals or magical beasts). This ability alters wild empathy.		SOURCEPAGE:P.98
Vermin Focus			KEY:Verminous Hunter ~ Vermin Focus				CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:HunterClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.Supernatural.HunterAnimalFocus								DESC:A verminous hunter can take on the aspect of a vermin. This functions as animal focus, but allows only the following choices. This ability replaces animal focus.	SOURCEPAGE:P.98
Swarm Stride			KEY:Verminous Hunter ~ Swarm Stride				CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:HunterClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.Extraordinary.HunterWoodlandStride							DESC:At 5th level, a verminous hunter learns to move through vermin without danger. He can safely pass through swarms of vermin and does not take swarm damage while within a vermin swarm's space. In addition, he is immune to a swarm’s distraction ability. If the hunter or his animal companion attacks a swarm, they lose this protection against only that swarm. This ability replaces woodland stride.	SOURCEPAGE:P.98

He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3+ his Charisma modifier. At each level after 1st, a skald can use raging song for 1 additional round per day. Affected allies gain +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +%1 morale bonus to Will saves, but also take a -1 penalty to AC.

This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack). Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual power more than once.																												BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Rage Power|RagePowersLVL/3										BONUS:VAR|RagePowersPrereqLVL|RagePowersLVL
Spell Kenning		KEY:Skald ~ Spell Kenning			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkaldClassFeatures.SkaldSpellKenning.Supernatural																						DESC:At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes' spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald's spells known, expending a skald spell slot of an appropriate level to cast the spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell. At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.
Lore Master			KEY:Skald ~ Lore Master				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkaldClassFeatures.SkaldLoreMaster.Extraordinary																						DESC:At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action. He can use this ability one additional time per day for every six levels he possesses beyond 5th, to a maximum of three times per day at 17th level.
Damage Reduction		KEY:Skald ~ Damage Reduction			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkaldClassFeatures.SkaldDamageReduction.Extraordinary																					DESC:At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th level this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0. The skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his raging song.
Dirge of Doom		KEY:Skald ~ Dirge of Doom			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkaldClassFeatures.SkaldDirgeOfDoom.Supernatural																						DESC:At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This works like raging song and expends rounds of raging song, but it only affects enemies within 30 feet who are able to hear the skald's performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and it relies on audible components. A skald may not use dirge of doom and raging song simultaneously.
Master Skald		KEY:Skald ~ Master Skald			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkaldClassFeatures.SkaldMasterSkald.Supernatural																						DESC:At 20th level, a skald's raging song no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills, abilities, or rage powers they can use.

She fights with panache: a fluctuating measure of a swashbuckler's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a swashbuckler gains %1 panache. Her panache goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than %2, though feats and magic items can affect this maximum. A swashbuckler spends panache to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains panache in the following ways..&nl;Critical Hit with a Light or One-Handed Piercing Melee Weapon ~ Each time the swashbuckler confirms a critical hit with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, she regains 1 panache point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the swashbuckler's character level doesn't restore panache.&nl;Killing Blow with a Light or One-Handed Piercing Melee Weapon ~ When the swashbuckler reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon attack while in combat, she regains 1 panache point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the swashbuckler's character level to 0 or fewer hit points doesn't restore any panache.|PanachePoints|PanacheMax																																										BONUS:VAR|PanachePoints|SwashbucklerPanachePoints	BONUS:VAR|SwashbucklerPanacheMax|CHA	BONUS:VAR|PanacheMax|SwashbucklerPanacheMax	BONUS:VAR|SwashbucklerPanachePoints|MAX(1,CHA)	BONUS:VAR|PanachePoints|PanachePointsFavoredBonus/4	BONUS:VAR|PanacheMax|PanacheMaxFavoredBonus/4							SOURCEPAGE:p.9

To use this deed, a swashbuckler cannot attack with a weapon in her other hand or use a shield other than a buckler. She can even use this ability with thrown light or one-handed piercing melee weapons, so long as the target is within 30 feet of her. Any creature that is immune to sneak attacks is immune to the additional damage granted by precise strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from the additional damage of a precise strike. This additional damage is precision damage, and isn't multiplied on a critical hit. As a swift action, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to deal %2 additional damage instead. This benefit must be used before the end of her turn, or it is lost.

This combination of two distinct bloodlines can create a versatile and powerful rager who stands out among the horde. A crossblooded rager selects two different bloodlines. He gains access to the feats, bonus spells, and some of the powers of both bloodlines he is descended from, but at the cost of reducing mental clarity (see Drawbacks below). If the crossblooded rager already has a bloodline from another class, one of the chosen bloodlines must be that bloodline.

Bonus Feats		KEY:Crossblooded Rager ~ Bonus Feats		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodrager ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:A crossblooded rager combines the bonus feat lists from both of his bloodlines and can select his bloodline bonus feats from this combined list.

Bonus Spells	KEY:Crossblooded Rager ~ Bonus Spells		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodrager ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:A crossblooded rager can select his bonus spells from either of his bloodlines. He can also learn a lower-level bonus spell he did not choose in place of the higher-level bonus spell he would normally gain. Lowerlevel bonus spells learned in this manner are always the spell level that they would be if the crossblooded rager had learned them with the appropriate bonus spell. For example: A 7th-level aberrant/abyssal crossblooded rager has the choice of learning enlarge person or ray of enfeeblement as his bloodline bonus spell. If he selected ray of enfeeblement as his 7th-level bonus spell, at 10th level he could use his new bonus spell to learn enlarge person instead of bull's strength or see invisibility, and he would add it to his list of 1st-level spells known ( just as if he had learned it as his 7th-level bonus spell).

Drawbacks		KEY:Crossblooded Rager ~ Drawbacks			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodrager ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:The furious mix of arcane power inside a crossblooded rager forces him to constantly expend mental effort to remain focused on his current situation and needs. This leaves him with less mental resolve available to deal with external threats. A crossblooded rager takes a –2 penalty to all Will saving throws at all times, and does not gain the +2 morale bonus on Will saving throws while bloodraging—though he does gain a +1 morale bonus Will saving throws when he gains the greater bloodrage class feature, which increases to a +2 morale bonus on saving throws upon gaining the mighty bloodrage class feature.

It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. You can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time - if you brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. A mutagen that is not in your possession becomes inert until it is picked up by either an mutagenic mauler or a mutagenic mauler. When you brew a mutagen, you select one physical ability score - either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It's a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes you to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting you a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for %1 minutes. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, you take a -2 penalty to one of your mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances your Strength, it applies a penalty to your Intelligence. If it enhances your Dexterity, it applies a penalty to your Wisdom. If it enhances your Constitution, it applies a penalty to your Charisma. If a non-mutagenic mauler or non-mutagenic mauler drinks a mutagen, they must make a DC %2 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 hour - a non-mutagenic mauler or non-mutagenic mauler can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an mutagenic mauler or a mutagenic mauler can gain the effects of another mutagenic mauler or mutagenic mauler's mutagen if drunk. (Although if the other mutagenic mauler or mutagenic mauler creates a different mutagen, the effects of the "stolen" mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever an mutagenic mauler or a mutagenic mauler drinks a mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end.

Weapon Focus		KEY:Warpriest ~ Weapon Focus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 1st level, a warpriest receives Weapon Focus as a bonus feat (choosing any weapon, not just his deity's favored weapon). If his deity's favored weapon is unarmed strike, he can instead select Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Weapon Focus|1
Blessings			KEY:Warpriest ~ Blessings				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:Blessings (Su): A warpriest's deity influences his alignment, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him. Each warpriest can select two blessings from among those granted by his deity (each deity grants the blessings tied to its domains). A warpriest can select an alignment blessing (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain. If a warpriest isn't devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two blessings to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities, subject to GM approval. He can call upon the power of his blessings %1 times per day. The DC for these blessings is: %2|(TL/2)+3|(TL/2)+10+WIS		BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Warpriest Blessing|2
Sacred Weapon		KEY:Warpriest ~ Sacred Weapon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:Sacred Weapon (Su): Weapons wielded by a warpriest are charged with the power of his faith. In addition to the favored weapon of his deity, the warpriest can designate a weapon as a sacred weapon by selecting that weapon with the Weapon Focus feat (if he has multiple Weapon Focus feats, this ability applies to all of them). Whenever the warpriest is wielding a sacred weapon, he treats his warpriest level as his base attack bonus for attacks made with that weapon, stacking with any base attack bonus from other classes or racial Hit Dice. In addition, the warpriest sacred weapon damage is based on his level and not the weapon type. The damage for Medium warpriests is listed on Table 1–13. If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This increase in damage does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The warpriest can decide to use the weapon’s base damage instead of the sacred weapon damage—this must be declared before the attack roll is made. At 4th level, the warpriest gains the ability to imbue his sacred weapon with divine power as a swift action. This power grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every four levels beyond 4th, this bonus increases by +1 to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the weapon might have, to a maximum of +5. The warpriest can imbue a weapon with any of the following weapon properties: brilliant energy, defending, disruption, flaming, frost,  keen, and  shock. In addition, if the warpriest is chaotic, he can add anarchicand vicious. If he is evil, he can add mighty cleavingand unholy. If he is good, he can add holyand merciful. If he is lawful, he can add axiomaticand ghost touch. Adding any of these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the properties base cost (see Table 15– 9 of the Core Rulebook). Duplicate abilities do not stack. The weapon must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any other properties can be added, whether normally from itself or granted by this ability.  The warpriest can use this ability one round per day per warpriest level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive. The enhancement bonus and properties are determined the f irst time the ability is used each day, and cannot be changed until the ability is used again the next day. These bonuses only apply while the warpriest is holding the weapon, and end immediately if the weapon is sheathed or leaves the warpriest’s possession. This ability can be ended as a free action at the start of the warpriest’s turn (and that round does not count against the total duration, unless the ability is resumed). If the warpriest uses this ability on a double weapon, the effects only apply to one end the weapon.
Sacred Armor		KEY:Warpriest ~ Sacred Armor			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarpriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:Sacred Armor (Su): At 7th level, the warpriest gains the ability to imbue his armor with divine power as a swift action. This power grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 7th, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +5 at 19th level.

The warpriest can imbue armor any of the following armor properties: energy resistance(normal, improved, and greater), fortification (heavy, light, or moderate), glamered, and spell resistance (13, 15, 17, and 19). Adding any of these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the properties base cost (see Table 15–4 of the Core Rulebook). For this purpose, glamered counts as a +1, energy resistancecounts as +2, improved energy resistance counts as +4, and greater energy resistancecounts as +5. Duplicate abilities do not stack. The armor must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any other properties can be added, whether normally from itself or granted by this ability. The warpriest can use this ability one minute per day per warpriest level, but these minutes do not need to be consecutive. The enhancement bonus and properties are determined the first time the ability is used each day and cannot be changed until the ability is used again the next day. These bonuses only apply while the warpriest is wearing the armor, and end immediately if the armor is removed or leaves the warpriest's possession. This ability can be ended as a free action at the start of the warpriest's turn. This ability cannot be applied to a shield.

It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. You can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time - if you brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. A mutagen that is not in your possession becomes inert until it is picked up by either an mutagenic mauler or a mutagenic mauler. When you brew a mutagen, you select one physical ability score - either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It's a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes you to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting you a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for %1 minutes. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, you take a -2 penalty to one of your mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances your Strength, it applies a penalty to your Intelligence. If it enhances your Dexterity, it applies a penalty to your Wisdom. If it enhances your Constitution, it applies a penalty to your Charisma. If a non-mutagenic mauler or non-mutagenic mauler drinks a mutagen, they must make a DC %2 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 hour - a non-mutagenic mauler or non-mutagenic mauler can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an mutagenic mauler or a mutagenic mauler can gain the effects of another mutagenic mauler or mutagenic mauler's mutagen if drunk. (Although if the other mutagenic mauler or mutagenic mauler creates a different mutagen, the effects of the "stolen" mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack.

This inflicts 2 points of Intelligence damage to the mutagenic mauler and costs 1,000 gp in rare reagents, but the mutagen created persists on its own and is not rendered inert if the mutagenic mauler creates another mutagen. This allows an mutagenic mauler to create different types of mutagens and keep them handy for emergencies. This does not allow an mutagenic mauler to gain the effects of multiple mutagens - only the most recently imbibed mutagen has any effect.

When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on you, there is a %1%% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.
