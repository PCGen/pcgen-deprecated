BONUS:WEAPONPROF=Earth Breaker|WIELDCATEGORY|-1|PREEQUIPTWOWEAPON:1,Klar	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	BENEFIT:You can use an earth breaker as though it were a one-handed weapon. When using an earth breaker in one hand and a klar in your off hand, you retain the shield bonus your klar grants to your Armor Class even when you use it to attack. Treat your klar as a light weapon for the purposes of determining your two-weapon fighting penalty.
Deadly Dealer	TYPE:General		PREFEAT:1,Arcane Strike											PRESKILL:1,Sleight of Hand=5				DESC:Your skill with handling cards and arcane talents allow you to turn mundane cards into deadly weapons.																								SOURCEPAGE:p.10	BENEFIT:You can throw a card as though it were a dart, with the same damage, range, and other features. You must use the Arcane Strike feat when throwing a card in this way, or else the card lacks the magical force and precision to deal lethal damage. A card is destroyed when thrown in this way. Harrow cards are treated as masterwork weapons when thrown using this feat, but are still destroyed after they are thrown. A harrow deck can no longer be used as a fortunetelling device after even a single card is thrown. A spellcaster with this feat can enhance a deck of cards as though it were a ranged weapon with 54 pieces of ammunition. This enhancement functions only when used in tandem with this feat, and has no affect on any other way the cards might be used. Only a character who possesses this feat can make use of an enhanced deck of cards, and must still use the Arcane Strike feat to activate the cards' enhancement.
