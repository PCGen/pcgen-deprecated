###Mythic Paths
Archmage			KEY:Archmage ~ Mythic		CATEGORY:Mythic Path	TYPE:MythicPath.SpecialQuality		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:A master of arcane magic, the archmage casts powerful spells with great skill and ease, and shapes reality at whim. The powers of the archmage allow her to alter her spells, penetrate foes' defenses, and master nearly any subject. While many of the archmage's abilities are most valuable to a character with a high Intelligence score, those with high Charisma scores will also find a wide variety of powerful options. The path of the archmage is suitable for arcane spellcasters.
Champion			KEY:Champion ~ Mythic		CATEGORY:Mythic Path	TYPE:MythicPath.SpecialQuality		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:Unparalleled in combat, the champion stands triumphant on the battlefield, surrounded by bruised and broken foes. The abilities of the champion allow him to deliver strikes more accurately, perform astounding combat maneuvers, and move effortlessly around the battlefield. Characters with a high Strength score will find this path extremely useful, as will those with a high Constitution score. The path of the champion is suitable for characters who rely on martial arms and combat maneuvers.
Guardian			KEY:Guardian ~ Mythic		CATEGORY:Mythic Path	TYPE:MythicPath.SpecialQuality		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:None can get past the impervious guardian, those who threaten this devout hero's charges are doomed to fail. The powers of the guardian allow her to hold her ground, protect her allies, prevent enemies from moving past her, and survive hits that would defeat lesser heroes. Characters that have a high Constitution score and frequently find themselves in the middle of combat gain valuable powers by becoming a guardian. The path of the guardian is suitable for those who routinely sustain massive amounts of damage.
Hierophant			KEY:Hierophant ~ Mythic		CATEGORY:Mythic Path	TYPE:MythicPath.SpecialQuality		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:Drawing on power that goes beyond the gods, the hierophant is an inviolate vessel for the divine. The abilities of the hierophant allow him to enhance the power of his spells, heal others with greater potency, and commune with the gods. Most characters that become hierophants have a high Wisdom score, although many also have an above-average Charisma score. The path of the hierophant is suitable for divine spellcasters.
Marshal				KEY:Marshal ~ Mythic		CATEGORY:Mythic Path	TYPE:MythicPath.SpecialQuality		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:Inspiration and courage make the marshal the greatest leader, capable of leading troops to victory over any challenge. The powers of the marshal allow her to inspire others, which grants bonuses and additional opportunities to all of her comrades.

The path of the marshal is suitable for those who continually aid others.
Trickster			KEY:Trickster ~ Mythic		CATEGORY:Mythic Path	TYPE:MythicPath.SpecialQuality		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:Skill, training, and savvy make the trickster the master of the impossible—defying unbeatable obstacles and traps, tricking the wise, and hitting otherwise unattainable targets. The trickster's abilities allow him to change his appearance, manipulate others, and strike with deadly accuracy. Characters with high Dexterity and Charisma scores have a lot to gain from becoming tricksters. The path of the trickster is suitable for those who rely on subterfuge and cunning.

###Mythic Abilities
Hard to Kill		KEY:Hard to Kill ~ Mythic			CATEGORY:Mythic Ability		TYPE:MythicAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:Whenever you're below 0 hit points, you automatically stabilize without needing to attempt a Constitution check. If you have an ability that allows you to act while below 0 hit points, you still lose hit points for taking actions, as specified by that ability. Bleed damage still causes you to lose hit points when below 0 hit points. In addition, you don't die until your total number of negative hit points is equal to or greater than double your Constitution score.
Mythic Power		KEY:Mythic Power ~ Mythic			CATEGORY:Mythic Ability		TYPE:MythicAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:Mythic characters can draw upon a wellspring of power to accomplish amazing deeds and cheat fate. This power is used by a number of different abilities. Each day, you can expend an amount of mythic power equal to 3 plus double your mythic tier (5/day at 1st tier, 7/day at 2nd, etc.). This amount is your maximum amount of mythic power. If an ability allows you to regain uses of your mythic power, you can never have more than this amount.
Mythic Surge		KEY:Mythic Surge ~ Mythic			CATEGORY:Mythic Ability		TYPE:MythicAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:You can call upon your mythic power to overcome difficult challenges. You can expend one use of mythic power to increase any d20 roll you just made by rolling 1d%1|MythicSurgeDieSize and adding it to the result. Using this ability is an immediate action taken after the result of the original roll is revealed. This can change the outcome of the roll.
Amazing Initiative	KEY:Amazing Initiative ~ Mythic		CATEGORY:Mythic Ability		TYPE:MythicAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:At 2nd tier, you gain a bonus on initiative checks equal to your mythic tier. In addition, as a free action on your turn, you can expend one use of mythic power to take an additional standard action during that turn.

Recuperation		KEY:Recuperation ~ Mythic			CATEGORY:Mythic Ability		TYPE:MythicAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:At 3rd tier, you are restored to full hit points after 8 hours of rest so long as you aren't dead. In addition, by expending one use of mythic power and resting for 1 hour, you regain a number of hit points equal to half your full hit points (up to a maximum of your full hit points) and regain the use of any class features that are limited to a certain number of uses per day (such as barbarian rage, bardic performance, spells per day, and so on). This rest is treated as 8 hours of sleep for such abilities. This rest doesn't refresh uses of mythic power or any mythic abilities that are limited to a number of times per day.
Mythic Surge Boost	KEY:Mythic Surge Boost ~ Mythic		CATEGORY:Mythic Ability		TYPE:MythicAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		CHOOSE:NOCHOICE			MULT:YES			STACK:YES			 BONUS:VAR|MythicSurgeDieSize|2
Mythic Saves		KEY:Mythic Saves ~ Mythic			CATEGORY:Mythic Ability		TYPE:MythicAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:At 5th tier, whenever you succeed at a saving throw against a spell or special ability, you suffer no effects as long as that ability didn't come from a mythic source (such as a creature with a mythic tier or mythic ranks). If you fail a saving throw that results from a mythic source, you take the full effects as normal.
Force of Will		KEY:Force of Will ~ Mythic			CATEGORY:Mythic Ability		TYPE:MythicAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:At 7th tier, you can exert your will to force events to unfold as you would like. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to reroll a d20 roll you just made, or force any non-mythic creature to reroll a d20 roll it just made. You can use this ability after the results are revealed. Whoever rerolls a roll must take the result of the second roll, even if it is lower.
Unstoppable			KEY:Unstoppable ~ Mythic			CATEGORY:Mythic Ability		TYPE:MythicAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:At 8th tier, you can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to immediately end any one of the following conditions currently affecting you: bleed, blind, confused, cowering, dazed, dazzled, deafened, entangled, exhausted, fascinated, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned. All other conditions and effects remain, even those resulting from the same spell or effect that caused the selected condition. You can use this ability at the start of your turn even if a condition would prevent you from acting.
Immortal			KEY:Immortal ~ Mythic				CATEGORY:Mythic Ability		TYPE:MythicAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:At 9th tier, if you are killed, you return to life 24 hours later, regardless of the condition of your body or the means by which you were killed. When you return to life, you aren't treated as if you had rested, and don't regain the use of abilities that recharge with rest until you next rest. This ability doesn't apply if you're killed by a coup de grace or critical hit performed by either a mythic creature (or creature of even greater power) or a non-mythic creature wielding a weapon capable of bypassing epic damage reduction. At 10th tier, you can be killed only by a coup de grace or critical hit made with an artifact.
Legendary Hero		KEY:Legendary Hero ~ Mythic			CATEGORY:Mythic Ability		TYPE:MythicAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:At 10th tier, you have reached the height of mortal power.

###Mythic Path Feature
Absorb Blow			CATEGORY:Mythic Path Feature	TYPE:MythicPathFeature.SpecialQuality		DESC:As an immediate action, whenever you take hit point damage from a single source (such as a dragon's breath, a spell, or a weapon), you can expend one use of mythic power to reduce the damage you take from that source by 5 per tier (to a minimum of 0 points of damage taken). If you have another ability or effect that reduces damage (such as protection from energy), reduce the damage with the absorb blow ability before applying any other damage-reducing effects. For every 10 points of damage that this ability prevents, for 1 minute you gain DR 1/epic and 5 points of resistance against acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic damage. The DR and resistances stack with any other DR and resistances that you have.	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=ANY,Guardian ~ Mythic
Advance				CATEGORY:Mythic Path Feature	TYPE:MythicPathFeature.SpecialQuality		DESC:As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to inspire a tactical advance on the field of battle. This allows you and each of your allies within 30 feet to take either a single move action of the character's choice or a 5-foot step, as long as you or your ally has the ability to take such an action (for example, an unconscious character still can't take an action). The action granted by this ability doesn't count toward the number or type of actions a creature is allowed to take on its turn.

Arcane Surge		CATEGORY:Mythic Path Feature	TYPE:MythicPathFeature.SpecialAttack		DESC:As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to cast any one arcane spell without expending a prepared spell or spell slot. If you prepare spells, this spell must be one you prepared today (even if you have already cast it); if you're a spontaneous caster, this spell must be one of your spells known. If the spell requires a saving throw, any non-mythic creatures affected by the spell roll twice and take the lower result. If you must attempt a caster level check for the spell to overcome a creature's spell resistance, you can roll your caster level check twice (adding your tier to each) and take the higher result. You can't add a metamagic feat to a spell you cast using this ability.				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=ANY,Archmage ~ Mythic
Beast's Fury		CATEGORY:Mythic Path Feature	TYPE:MythicPathFeature.SpecialAttack		DESC:As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to imbue your animal companion, cohort, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount with some of your mythic power. As an immediate action, that creature can move up to its speed and make an attack with one of its natural weapons. When making this attack, the creature rolls twice and takes the higher result. Any damage dealt by this attack bypasses all damage reduction. A creature affected by this ability can take these actions in addition to any others that it takes during its turn.

Deadly Throw		CATEGORY:Mythic Path Feature	TYPE:MythicPathFeature.SpecialAttack		DESC:As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to draw a thrown weapon or alchemical item and make a ranged attack with it.

PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=ANY,Marshal ~ Mythic
Distant Barrage		CATEGORY:Mythic Path Feature	TYPE:MythicPathFeature.SpecialAttack		DESC:As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make a ranged attack at your highest attack bonus.

Inspired Spell		CATEGORY:Mythic Path Feature	TYPE:MythicPathFeature.SpecialAttack		DESC:You can expend one use of mythic power to cast any one divine spell, treating your caster level as 2 levels higher. This spell must be on your divine spell list (or your domain or mystery spell list) and must be of a spell level that you can cast using that divine spellcasting class. If you are a spontaneous spellcaster, you don't need to have the spell prepared, nor does it need to be on your list of spells known. Using this ability does not expend a prepared spell or available spell slot. You can apply any metamagic feats you know to this spell, but its total spell slot level must be a slot level you can normally cast.																							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=ANY,Hierophant ~ Mythic
Mage Strike			CATEGORY:Mythic Path Feature	TYPE:MythicPathFeature.SpecialAttack		DESC:As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make one melee attack. This is in addition to any other attacks you make this round.

The normal damage from this attack bypasses all damage reduction, but the energy damage is still affected by resistances and immunities.																										PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=ANY,Archmage ~ Mythic
Rally				CATEGORY:Mythic Path Feature	TYPE:MythicPathFeature.SpecialQuality		DESC:As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to rally your allies.

PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=ANY,Marshal ~ Mythic
Recalled Blessing	CATEGORY:Mythic Path Feature	TYPE:MythicPathFeature.SpecialAttack		DESC:You can expend one use of mythic power to cast any one divine spell without expending a prepared spell or spell slot.

When you make a surprise strike, the target is considered flat-footed regardless of any class features or abilities it might have, and you add your tier to the attack roll. Damage from this attack bypasses damage reduction.																																																																														PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=ANY,Trickster ~ Mythic
Wild Arcana			CATEGORY:Mythic Path Feature	TYPE:MythicPathFeature.SpecialAttack		DESC:As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to cast any one arcane spell without expending a prepared spell or spell slot. The spell must be on one of your arcane class spell lists and must be of a level that you can cast with that arcane spellcasting class. You don't need to have the spell prepared, nor does it need to be on your list of spells known. When casting a spell in this way, you treat your caster level as 2 levels higher for the purpose of any effect dependent on level. You can apply any metamagic feats you know to this spell, but its total adjusted level can't be greater than that of the highest-level arcane spell you can cast from that spellcasting class.								PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=ANY,Archmage ~ Mythic
Divine Vessel		CATEGORY:Mythic Path Feature	TYPE:MythicPathFeature.SpecialQuality		DESC:At 10th tier, whenever you cast a spell that targets one or more non-mythic creatures, those creatures must roll twice for any saving throws associated with the spell and take the lower result.

Shifting Mastery				KEY:Shifting Mastery ~ Mythic				CATEGORY:Mythic Path Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:Whenever you cast or use an arcane polymorph spell, you can grant the target the ability to expend 1 minute of the spell's duration to assume another form allowed by the spell. Changing form in this way is a standard action. The target can assume another form as often as it likes for the duration of the spell. If you're the target, you can change forms as a swift action rather than a standard action. If you expend one use of mythic power when you cast the spell, you can also grant the target the ability to assume the shape of one specific individual that the spell could duplicate (for example, the target could use polymorph to assume the form of a specific animal, humanoid, or elemental, but not a dragon because dragon forms aren't allowed by polymorph). This specific creature must be known to you, but it doesn't have to be known by the target. The target gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to pass as that individual, but Bluff checks or knowledge of the individual might be required to make the disguise truly convincing.

Tear Apart						KEY:Tear Apart ~ Mythic						CATEGORY:Mythic Path Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:You can attempt to rend the armor of your opponent, reducing its effectiveness. Using this ability is a standard action that requires you to attempt a sunder combat maneuver check against your foe. If the check is successful, reduce the target's armor bonus, natural armor bonus, or shield bonus (your choice) by half your tier (minimum 1). If the creature has an enhancement bonus to the bonus you chose, reduce the normal bonus first, then apply any leftover reduction to the enhancement bonus. You can't reduce the bonus below 0. Armor and shields damaged in this way can be repaired as if they had the broken condition. Natural armor regains the lost bonus at the rate of 1 point per day.

You can attempt a skill check with a class skill in place of a skill that uses the same ability score modifier. For example, you could attempt an Acrobatics check in place of a Stealth check because both skills are based on Dexterity. You take a –5 penalty on this check and can't take 10 or 20 on it. The GM can disallow certain uses of this ability when the skill can't possibly be applied to the task.			PREVAREQ:MythicLevel,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=ANY,Trickster ~ Mythic

Thwart Detection				KEY:Thwart Detection ~ Mythic				CATEGORY:Mythic Path Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:You can bypass magical constructs, spells, and traps that are meant to allow only certain creatures to move or act within their range. This includes constructs, spells, and traps that can be bypassed with a password as well as those that can be programmed to exclude specific creatures based on type or other physical characteristics (such as alarm, forbiddance, glyph of warding, and symbol of death). You must be aware of the construct, spell, or trap's existence, though not necessarily its specific parameters, for this ability to function. For instance, you can't bypass a trap you haven't noticed. You can fool a mindless construct if it was programmed to allow certain creatures to enter its area without provoking a response, but not if it was ordered to prevent anyone from entering with no exceptions. If you expend one use of mythic power for each effect, you can bring with you a number of allies equal to your tier. They must remain within 10 feet of you until out of range of the bypassed effect.			PREVAREQ:MythicLevel,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=ANY,Trickster ~ Mythic

If speaking to creatures of different types at the same time, you can allow all of them to understand you or speak understandably to just one type at a time. For example, if speaking to a group of animals and fey, you can make yourself understandable to all of them, just to the animals, or just to the fey.

Transfer Magic					KEY:Transfer Magic ~ Mythic					CATEGORY:Mythic Path Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:Your mythic nature allows you to take magic from others as easily as you could take their gold. By expending one use of mythic power as a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack to transfer an active magical effect from a target creature to you. If you succeed, the highest-level effect on the target transfers to you (determine randomly if the target has multiple effects with the same level), ending the effect for the target and continuing it on you with the remaining duration as if you were the original target. You may end the effect on yourself as a standard action; this doesn't cause it to revert to the original target. If the transferred magic can't affect you (for example, if it doesn't affect creatures of your type), it ends immediately as if dispelled. You can't use this ability to transfer continuous bonuses from magic items, such as an armor bonus from bracers of armor.

If your Use Magic Device check overcomes the DC to disable the trap by 5 or more, you can instead leave the trap in place, but change it so that you and your allies can bypass it. You can also alter the trap so the original creator and any creatures he might have designated as safe instead set off the trap. If you expend one use of mythic power when altering a trap in this way, you can move the trap to any point within 100 feet that is in line of sight.

If you do, attempt your confirmation roll as normal and add your tier to the result. If the result is equal to or greater than your opponent's CMD, the attack deals damage as normal and you can attempt a free dirty trick, disarm, reposition, or trip combat maneuver check against that opponent, using the confirmation roll as your combat maneuver check for the purpose of determining the effects of the maneuver.

Uncanny Grapple					KEY:Uncanny Grapple ~ Mythic				CATEGORY:Mythic Path Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:Upon making a successful grapple combat maneuver check against a creature you are grappling, you can perform one of the following actions: throw, crush, or swing. For a throw, you can throw the target of your grapple up to 10 feet per tier; if the creature strikes a solid object before reaching this distance, it takes 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of the remaining throwing distance and lands prone. For a crush, you deal 1d6 points of non-lethal damage per tier. For a swing, you can use the target as a weapon against another creature, treating the grappled creature as a two-handed weapon. If you succeed at a melee attack against an opponent adjacent to the target, both that opponent and the grappled creature take 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage from this attack + 1-1/2 × your Strength modifier.

If you expend one use of mythic power when you use this ability, this damage ignores the hardness of the wall. If the damage destroys the wall, you move the opponent into the space beyond the wall and it immediately falls prone.

You can quickly create a temporary potion by casting a spell into a pint of water. The spell must be a valid choice for the Brew Potion feat and have a spell level no higher than your tier. The targeted liquid becomes a potion of that spell. If not consumed, the temporary potion reverts to normal water after 1 hour per tier.

You can continue to apply excess healing to other adjacent allies until no injured allies are adjacent or you run out of excess healing. For example, if you could cure 40 points of damage with your cure critical wounds spell and the target has taken only 20 points of damage, you can apply the remaining 20 points of healing to an adjacent ally; if that second ally has taken only 15 points of damage, you can apply the remaining 5 points of healing to another adjacent ally.

Alignment Insight		KEY:Alignment Insight ~ Mythic		CATEGORY:Mythic Path Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:You can automatically detect the alignment of any outsider you can see. This ability doesn't function if the creature is magically disguised or has been polymorphed into a different shape. You can automatically detect the alignment of any creature you see casting a divine spell; if that creature worships a deity, you also learn its deity. Spells and effects that mask a creature's alignment prevent the use of this ability. Whenever you cast a spell that affects creatures differently based on their alignment(such as holy smite), you may have the spell treat creatures of one particular alignment as an alignment one step away from that alignment. For example, when casting holy smite, you could treat all lawful neutral creatures as lawful good or lawful evil, all chaotic neutral creature as chaotic good or chaotic evil, or all neutral creatures as neutral good or neutral evil.

For the next 10 rounds, you can apply this metamagic feat to any arcane spell you cast without increasing the spell slot used or casting time. You can also use this ability on an arcane spell you cast from a scroll, staff, or wand. You can't have more than one use of this ability active at a time. If you use this ability again, any previous use immediately ends (though this doesn't affect spells already cast). You can select this ability more than once.

You can select this ability more than once. If you choose the same arcane spellcasting class a second time, you gain four bonus 2nd-level spell slots; if you choose it again, you gain 3rdlevel slots for choosing it a third time, and so on.

If you violate the code of ethics of any of your classes, you might still lose access to certain features of such classes, subject to GM discretion. Attempts to detect your alignment don't return any results. If a class restricts you from casting spells with an alignment descriptor, you can cast such spells without restrictions or repercussions. If you're the target of a spell or effect that is based on alignment, you're treated as the most favorable alignment when determining the spell's effect on you.

If it would normally take a standard or move action, it instead takes a swift action. If it would normally take a swift or free action, it instead takes no time at all.

Select two domains upon taking this ability. These domains must be alignment domains matching your alignment if possible, unless your alignment is neutral.

You can select this ability more than once. Each time you select it, the attack bonus on additional attacks increases by another 5.

If the initial scrying effect allows the target a saving throw, the sensor's creator can attempt a saving throw with a DC equal to 10 plus double your tier to realize you are attempting to observe it and block this attempt. If you act strangely once you notice the sensor, its creator might realize you're aware of it; at the GM's discretion, you may need to attempt a Bluff check against the creator's Sense Motive.

This change lasts for a number of minutes equal to your tier. During this time, you're treated as if you had always had the new class feature. For example, you could use this ability to change the decision made with the arcane bond class feature, causing your bonded item to disappear (along with all of its bonuses and restrictions) and a familiar to appear in its place. This doesn't affect any prepared spells or spells you have already cast. If the new ability is limited in its uses per day, you receive half the normal number of uses (minimum 1). When this ability ends, your previous choice returns with the same number of uses as before you used this ability. If you use this ability to change a class feature that grants access to spells (such as a bloodline, patron, domain, or school), you lose access to any spells from the old choice but don't gain the ability to cast new spells. When the effect ends, the previous spells return and can be cast again. You can use this ability to change a feat or skill if you receive it from a class feature, but any other abilities that rely on the missing feat or skill as a prerequisite don't function while this ability is in effect.

If you're healed to full hit points, you come back to life and gain 1 permanent negative level for each minute you were dead (these negative levels can be removed as normal). Until you're healed to full hit points, you don't regain consciousness and are still dead no matter what other abilities you might have. If you aren't brought back to life within a number of minutes equal to your total character level, your death is permanent (although you can still be brought back by spells such as raise dead).

When you are hit by or fail a saving throw against an arcane spell that deals hit point damage, as an immediate action you can choose to take damage as if that spell were affected by the Maximize Spell feat. If the spell's damage can't be increased by the Maximize Spell feat or is already under the effect of the Maximize Spell feat, you instead take double damage from it. The spell's damage ignores your spell resistance, energy resistance, energy immunities, and other protections against damage.

You can extend this effect for 1 round at the start of your next turn by expending another use of mythic power as a free action. Though the creature can't be killed by hit point damage, any damage it takes still applies to its current hit points. When this ability's effect ends, the creature falls unconscious or dies if its current hit points or other circumstances would otherwise cause it to do so.

Use the bonuses to attack and damage from the least powerful weapon thrown (for example, if you have one +2 dagger and 20 masterwork daggers, the attacks are treated as masterwork daggers).

Once per turn as a free action, each of your allies can either move up to its speed or make one melee or ranged attack at its full base attack bonus. These actions don't count against its actions for the turn. Once activated, this ability lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier, but immediately ends if you don't damage an opponent with an attack or spell on your turn.

By expending one use of mythic power, you gain an effect similar to frightful presence, except that creatures are affected according to their tier (or rank, in the case of monsters) instead of their Hit Dice. Non-mythic creatures that fail their saves are panicked for 1 minute, and those that succeed are shaken for 1 minute. Creatures with a mythic tier or rank equal to or less than your tier are unaffected if they succeed, and are shaken for 1 minute if they fail.

The sanctum takes up a space equal to six 20-foot cubes per tier, shapeable when you first create it as if it were a spell whose area or effect is shapeable. The sanctum is permanent and persistent, so you can store objects within the sanctum and retrieve them on future visits. The sanctum includes one unseen servant per tier. When you conjure the sanctum's door, you decide which creatures can see and use it (to all other creatures it's invisible and impermeable). The door remains until you dismiss it—a standard action with unlimited range as long as you are on the same plane as the door. If you dismiss the door while you are outside the sanctum, all creatures other than your familiar are immediately shunted outside. Conjuring the door automatically dismisses any other active door. As a full-round action, your familiar can enter or leave the sanctum from any square adjacent to you, without using the conjured door.

Servant of Balance			KEY:Servant of Balance ~ Mythic			CATEGORY:Mythic Path Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:Whenever a critical hit is confirmed against you, the attack deals normal damage instead of critical damage. Other effects that trigger on a successful critical hit (such as the Blinding Critical feat, the fire damage from a critical hit with a flaming burst weapon, or the effects of a vorpal weapon) all affect you normally.

Shatter Spells				KEY:Shatter Spells ~ Mythic				CATEGORY:Mythic Path Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:You can destroy a magical effect (whether it's on a creature or an independent effect such as a wall of fire) by attacking it with an unarmed strike or natural weapon. You must succeed at a melee touch attack against the creature or effect and expend one use of mythic power. If this attack hits, the creature or effect is subject to targeted greater dispel magic, using double your tier as your caster level. If you dispel an effect, you suffer no harmful effects from touching it. If the effect is on a creature, the creature takes 1 point of damage per spell level of each effect dispelled.

Steal Power					KEY:Steal Power ~ Mythic				CATEGORY:Mythic Path Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:By attempting a melee touch attack as a standard action, you can try to steal mythic power from another creature. The target must have at least one use of mythic power available. If the attack hits, attempt an opposed d20 roll against the target, adding your tier. If your total exceeds that of the target, the target loses one use of mythic power and you gain one use. You can use this ability on a given creature only once per day.

Surge of Inspiration		KEY:Surge of Inspiration ~ Mythic		CATEGORY:Mythic Path Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:Your very presence pushes those around you to be their very best. As an immediate action, when an ally within line of sight misses with an attack or fails a saving throw, you can expend one use of mythic power or your confidence ability to grant the ally the benefits of your surge ability on that attack roll or saving throw. The ally uses your surge die, and can apply the bonus after the result is revealed, possibly turning a failure into a success.

Sweeping Strike				KEY:Sweeping Strike ~ Mythic			CATEGORY:Mythic Path Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:Even when you're swarmed, your foes are not safe from danger. Whenever you could make a full attack, you may instead make a single attack at your highest attack bonus and apply the results to all opponents within your reach. Roll damage once and apply it to all opponents hit by the attack. This attack can't deal precision damage. If the attack roll is a critical threat, choose one target you hit and attempt to confirm the critical against that target.

Take the Hit				KEY:Take the Hit ~ Mythic				CATEGORY:Mythic Path Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:You are a living shield for your allies. Whenever an adjacent ally takes damage from a melee or ranged attack, as an immediate action you can split the damage. You take half of the damage (rounded down), and your ally takes the remaining amount. This damage is not subject to any resistances or damage reduction you might have, but any such defenses the target of the attack possesses apply before the damage is split. You don't suffer any other effects from the attack (such as disease, grab, or poison).			PREVAREQ:MythicLevel,6,7,8,9,10				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=ANY,Guardian ~ Mythic

Unending Performance		KEY:Unending Performance ~ Mythic		CATEGORY:Mythic Path Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:You can imbue an ally with power that lingers for a full day. Whenever you use a spell, bardic performance, or another class feature to grant a morale or competence bonus, you can designate any one creature affected by this bonus. The designated creature keeps this bonus for up to 24 hours. You can have only one creature designated in this way at a time. If you designate a new creature, the bonus immediately ends for the previous target. The creature you designate must be one of the targets when you cast the spell, start the performance, or use the class feature.

Undying Healer				KEY:Undying Healer ~ Mythic				CATEGORY:Mythic Path Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:Whenever you fall unconscious, a ghostly image of you manifests from out of your body. Even though you're unconscious, you control this image. On your turn each round, this image can fly up to 30 feet and use your ability to lay on hands to heal, channel energy to heal, or cast any conjuration (healing) spell that you could cast. This consumes these abilities as normal. Abilities used by the image can't benefit you. This image lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier. This ability can be dispelled, using double your tier as the caster level. If you die or regain consciousness, the image immediately ends.

You gain immunity to non-mythic mind-affecting effects, though you can choose to be affected by them if you wish. When subject to a mind-affecting effect from a mythic source, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to gain immunity to that effect.

Words of Valor				KEY:Words of Valor ~ Mythic				CATEGORY:Mythic Path Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:With a mere speech, you empower your allies to take on any foe. As a standard action, you can expend two uses of mythic power to inspire all of your allies within a 30-foot radius, granting them the effects of the spell heroism and making them immune to fear for 1 round per tier. Each mythic creature that is affected by this ability can use its surge ability once during this duration without having to expend one use of mythic power.
