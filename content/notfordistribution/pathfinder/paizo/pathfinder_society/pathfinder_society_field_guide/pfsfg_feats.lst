Equipment Trick		TYPE:Combat		PREATT:1	DESC:You understand how to use a certain item in combat.	STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:ABILITY|Special Ability|TYPE=EquipmentTrick	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	BENEFIT:You may use any equipment tricks relating to the item if you meet the appropriate trick requirements. If the item would normally be considered an improvised weapon, you may treat it as a normal weapon or an improvised weapon, whichever is more beneficial for you. You can gain the Equipment Trick feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of equipment.

Skill Specialization		DESC:Many of the prestige awards and recognitions or resources that faction members purchase allow a character to become specialized in a skill. When a PC becomes specialized in a skill, that skill immediately becomes a class skill for her. If the PC gains that skill as a class skill from any other source (either before or after you purchase the prestige resource), she gains a +1 competence bonus on those skill checks.	SOURCEPAGE:p.13
