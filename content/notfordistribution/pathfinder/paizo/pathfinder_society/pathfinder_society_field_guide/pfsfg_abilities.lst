###Block: Sunrod Tricks
# Ability Name		Unique Key						Category of Ability		Type						Description																																																																														Source Page
Flare				KEY:Flare ~ Sunrod Trick			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:As a standard action, you can expend the remaining life of a sunrod (lit or unlit) in an instant. Sighted reatures within a 20-foot-radius burst of the sunrod must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 2d4 rounds. Creatures with light sensitivity or light blindness receive a −2 penalty on their saving throws. Alternatively, as a full-round action, you can strike a creature with the sunrod or throw the sunrod as a ranged attack with a range increment of 10 feet. When it strikes a hard surface, it f lares as describe above. Since you don’t have to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at the corner of particular 5-foot square. Treat the target corner as AC 5. If a creature is struck by the sunrod and fails its Fortitude save, it is blinded for the first round of its dazzled condition.																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.49

SOURCEPAGE:p.49
Lure				KEY:Lure ~ Sunrod Trick			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:As a move action while holding a lit sunrod in your hand, you can attempt to move an animal in any direction you desire. Make a Handle Animal check against a DC of 15 + the target animal's CR. If you are successful, the animal moves 5 feet in the desired direction on its next turn. For every 5 points by which your check exceeds the DC, the animal moves another 5 feet, up to the animal's maximum speed. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, though if one is taken, the animal immediately stops moving (whether or not the attack hits). You cannot move an animal into an obvious hazard with this trick, but you can (for example) lure it into an open cage.																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.49
Twice as Brightly	KEY:Twice as Brightly ~ Sunrod Trick	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:As full-round action, you can tamper with an unused sunrod such that it burns out in a single hour, but shines much more brightly. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and increases the light level by two steps for an additional 30 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes normal light, and dim light or normal light becomes bright light).

###Block: Prestige Award - Vanity - Businesses
#While adventuring can be lucrative, it doesn't provide the job security some Pathfinders might wish for, nor does it provide a creative outlet for those with an artistic flair. As such, many Pathfinders own or operate small businesses on the side when not traveling the Inner Sea for the Society. A PC may purchase the same business more than once, with each purchase representing the endeavor's growth over time. Circumstance bonuses granted by businesses stack, including for multiple instances of a given vanity. You can purchase more than one business, but this does not increase the number of times per session that you can make a Day Job check.

###Block: Prestige Award - Vanity - Followers
#Not every Pathfinder is a natural loner or forced by circumstance to work in a team with others like him. In fact, some have small retinues of underlings who travel with them, taking care of menial tasks and hoping to soak up some of the glory that comes from adventuring with a member of the Pathfinder Society. All of the followers listed below are noncombatants, and should be utilized as flavor for a character, not as a means of slowing down the game and overcomplicating the board with unneeded minis. You can have a maximum number of followers equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum of 1); you may dismiss a follower from service at any time if you wish to gain different followers, but do not regain spent Prestige Points when you do so. If your Charisma is lowered by an effect, this does not impact any followers you may have already purchased, but does affect the number of new followers you can gain.
# TODO limit the number of Followers to Charisma mod.
