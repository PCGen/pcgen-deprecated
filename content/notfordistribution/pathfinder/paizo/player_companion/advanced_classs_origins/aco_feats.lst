Ambush Sense			TYPE:Combat				PRESTAT:1,INT=13	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.TrapSenseClassFeature		DESC:You live in dangerous times, and are alert for betrayal or unexpected attack.	BENEFIT:You gain a bonus on Perception checks made to determine awareness for the surprise round of combat, and a dodge bonus to AC in any surprise round in which you get to act. These bonuses are equal to the bonus you gain from trap sense.	SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Amplified Hex			TYPE:General			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.HexClassFeature					DESC:You have learned to augment your hexes with the energy of your spells.	BENEFIT:You can augment the power of a hex by expending a spell slot or prepared spell of at least 1st level. Each additional time you use this ability in the same day, it requires a prepared spell or spell slot 1 level higher (a 2nd-level spell the second time, a 3rdlevel spell the third time, and so on). When you amplify a hex, you can choose one: increase its saving throw DC by 1, increase its range by 30 feet (if it already has at least a 30-foot range), or increase its duration by 1 round (if it already has a duration of at least 1 round).	SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Daggermark Lore			TYPE:General			PRESKILL:1,Craft (Alchemy)=5		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.PoisonLoreClassFeature,TYPE.PoisonLoreClassFeature	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Background,DaggermarkPoisonersGuild	DESC:You understand the exclusive poisons brewed by your guild far better than the buyers you sell to, and you can deliver them so they are more difficult to weather.	BENEFIT:Choose one poison. When you deliver that poison, the number of saves needed to cure it increases by 1, and the DC to cure it with neutralize poison increases by 5. Succeeding at the initial save still negates the poison. Typical poisons used by Daggermark poisoners are listed in Pathfinder Player Companion: Alchemy Manual and Pathfinder Chronicles: Guide to the River Kingdoms. Additionally, if you have the poison lore class feature, you're considered to have the poison use class feature for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.	SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Eldritch Aid			TYPE:General			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=1	DESC:You have been trained to expend your own spell energy to boost the effects of an ally's spell.	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can expend a 1st-level or higher prepared spell or spell slot to grant additional magic energy to an allied spellcaster within close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels). If that ally casts an instantaneous spell of an equal or lower level before the beginning of your next turn, all level-dependent calculations and caster level checks the spell requires are made as if the ally's caster level were 2 higher. If the prepared spell or spell slot you expended is at least twice the level of the spell your ally casts, your ally's caster level is treated as 4 higher instead. If your ally is able to cast more than one spell before the beginning of your next turn, only the first spell cast gains this bonus.	SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Expanded Spell Kenning	TYPE:General			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.SpellKenningClassFeature	DESC:You are learned in a broader range of spell traditions than most.	BENEFIT:When you use your spell kenning class feature, you can select a spell from either the druid or the witch spell list.	SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Expanded Studies		TYPE:General			PRESTAT:1,WIS=17	PRECLASS:1,Hunter=16,Warpriest=16	DESC:You're part of a group or organization with access to greater magical mysteries than you understand yourself, and you have learned from your colleagues' eldritch expertise.	BENEFIT:You add 7th-level spells to your spell list for purposes of using spell completion and spell trigger magic items. If you're a hunter, you add 7th-level druid spells to your list. If you're a warpriest, you add 7th-level cleric spells to your list. This doesn't give you the ability to cast spells of this level, only to act as though your spell list included them when using appropriate magic items. For example, a 16th-level hunter has access to druid spells of only 1st to 6th levels. Thus, the hunter can't use spell completion or spell trigger magic items of druid spells of 7th level or higher without succeeding at a Use Magic Device check. If the hunter takes Eldritch Studies, she doesn't gain the ability to cast 7th-level druid spells, but she could use a scroll of heal or a wand of summon nature's ally VII without needing to attempt a Use Magic Device check.

Fencing Grace			TYPE:Combat				PRESTAT:1,DEX=13	PREFEAT:2,Weapon Finesse,Weapon Focus (Rapier)	BONUS:WEAPONPROF|DAMAGE|(max(STR,DEX)-STR)|TYPE=NotRanged	DESC:Your dashing style and fluid rapier forms allow you to use agility rather than brute force to fell your foes.	BENEFIT:When wielding a rapier one-handed, you can add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to that weapon's damage. The rapier must be one appropriate for your size. In addition, if you have the panache class feature, you gain a +2 bonus to CMD against attempts to disarm you of your rapier while you have at least 1 panache point.	SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Fighting Frenzy			TYPE:Combat.Teamwork	PRESTAT:1,CHA=13	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RageClassFeature	DESC:You feed off the rage of your allies.	BENEFIT:When you are in a rage and an ally with this feat within 60 feet is in a rage, you don't take the normal –2 penalty to AC for being in a rage. If you would take a larger penalty to AC for being in a rage, reduce that penalty by 2.	SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Know Weakness			TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.BardicKnowledgeClassFeature	DESC:You are well versed in the susceptibilities of your foes.	BENEFIT:When you successfully identify a creature with the appropriate Knowledge check, you gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against that creature for 1 round.	SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Mad Magic				TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.BloodrageClassFeature,TYPE.PerfectClarityRagePower	DESC:Magic is in your blood, allowing you to cast spells no matter how furious you become.	BENEFIT:You can cast spells from any class that grants you spells while in a bloodrage, and you keep your rage benefits when using moment of clarity during a rage. If you have the greater bloodrage class feature, you also gain a +1 bonus to the save DCs of spells you cast while in a bloodrage.	SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Onslaught				TYPE:Combat				PRESTAT:1,STR=13	PREFEAT:1,Power Attack	PRETOTALAB:1		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.SneakAttackClassFeature	DESC:No one is prepared for how hard you strike until they see it firsthand.	BENEFIT:If you use Power Attack with the first melee attack you make during a surprise round, you can sneak attack even if you are not flanking your target and it's not denied its Dexterity bonus to AC.	SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Pack Tactics			TYPE:General			PRESTAT:1,INT=13	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Animal Companion ~ Base	DESC:You have trained your animal companion to fight using your tactics.	BENEFIT:Your animal companion is treated as having all the same teamwork feats that you do for the purpose of determining whether you or your allies receive a bonus from teamwork feats. Your animal companion doesn't receive any bonuses from these feats unless it actually possesses the teamwork feats. Your and all allies' positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in a teamwork feat's description in order to receive the teamwork feat's listed bonus.	SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Totem Beast				TYPE:General			PRESTAT:1,WIS=13	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Animal Companion ~ Base		DESC:Your animal companion becomes spiritually connected to an animal totem that has a spiritual signif icance for you or your background, such as a Shoanti clan's animal totem.	BENEFIT:Select one animal aspect from the list presented in the hunter class's animal focus class feature. Your animal companion has natural coloration suggestive of this aspect-a bear might have a dark spot in the shape of a bat, or a hawk might have unusual tiger striping in its feathers. Your animal companion gains the benefits of the selected animal aspect, treating its Hit Dice as its effective hunter level for this ability. This bonus doesn't stack if the animal companion is already under the benefit of the same animal aspect because of the actual class feature. For example, an animal companion with Totem Beast (snake) under the effect of the snake aspect from its hunter owner would get a +2 bonus on attack rolls when making attacks of opportunity, not a +4 bonus.	SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Unfair Grip				TYPE:Combat				PRESTAT:1,STR=13	PRESTAT:1,DEX=13	PREFEAT:3,Improved Grapple,Improved Unarmed Strike,Power Attack		PRETOTALAB:1	DESC:You learned to fight in places that have no rules of engagement, such as the back alleys of Absalom or the fighting pits of the Sodden Lands, and you can grab foes in ways that are difficult to escape.	BENEFIT:When you perform a grapple combat maneuver, you gain a +1 bonus on checks to maintain your grapple, and your grappled foes take a –1 penalty on checks to escape your grapple.	SOURCEPAGE:p.27
