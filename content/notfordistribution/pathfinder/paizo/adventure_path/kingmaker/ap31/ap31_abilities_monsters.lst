###Block: Carbuncle abilities
# Ability Name			Unique Key							Category of Ability		Type								Define								Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													Source Page		Aspects
Empath				KEY:Empath ~ Carbuncle					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Communicate										DESC:Carbuncles possess a crude form of telepathy, allowing them to transmit mild impressions and remembered sensations to other creatures. This form of telepathy cannot convey language or hinder a target in any way (such as by transmitting pain). A carbuncle can relate a feeling of fear or the faint smell of leaves, but not directly warn an ally that it sees a monster or tell of a treasure under a pile of leaves.																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.76	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|30 ft.:
Fatal Faker				KEY:Fatal Faker ~ Carbuncle				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural												DESC:As a standard action, three times per day, a carbuncle can teleport as per the spell Dimension Door, but only to a range of 30 feet. Upon teleporting, the carbuncle leaves behind a perfect replica of itself amid a colored flash and the sound of a reptilian choke. This replica duplicates the carbuncle in all ways, though it is obviously dead and the colorless stone in its head is reduced to worthless dust. For all other purposes, the body left behind is treated as though it were an item created by minor creation. Any attempt to heal or resurrect this "body" fails. Dispel Magic and similar spells cause the body to vanish, though after 12 hours, the replica melts away into sweet-smelling ooze.																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.76
Specious Suggestion		KEY:Specious Suggestion ~ Carbuncle			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural			DEFINE:CarbuncleSpeciousSuggestionDC|10+(HD/2)+WIS	DESC:As a standard action, three times per day, a carbuncle can concentrate intently on one creature within its line of sight and attempt to impose its will upon the target. Carbuncles have difficulty forcing their wills upon non-carbuncles (and indeed carbuncles are immune to the suggestive powers of other carbuncles), resulting in one of the effects listed below. When using this ability a carbuncle must roll 1d6 for one of the following results: 1 - The carbuncle grants the target a flash of insight into the true future. The target gains a +2 bonus to its AC for the next round. 2 - The target is alerted to dangers the carbuncle perceives. The target gains a +2 bonus on any initiative roll made in the next minute. 3 - The carbuncle manifests a random image in the target's mind (usually of a food or strangely colored animal). This image lasts for only a moment and has no other effect. 4 - The carbuncle's thoughts affect the target similarly to the spell Suggestion, though the compulsion lasts for only 1 minute. 5 - The carbuncle's thoughts garble those of its target. The target takes a -2 penalty on Will saves for the next round. 6 - The carbuncle grants the target a vision of a false future. The target takes a -2 penalty to its AC for the next round. If the carbuncle dislikes the result, it may make a DC 15 Wisdom check to add or subtract 1 from the result. If the ability check fails, the result changes opposite from the way intended. Targets may attempt to resist the negative effects of a carbuncle's suggestion by making a DC %1 Will save. The carbuncle need not share a language with its target to convey its suggestions. This is a mind-affecting effect.|CarbuncleSpeciousSuggestionDC	SOURCEPAGE:p.76
Vulnerability to Suggestion	KEY:Vulnerability to Suggestion ~ Carbuncle	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Weakness										DESC:Carbuncles prove highly vulnerable to spells with the mind-affecting descriptor. Any mind-affecting spell can affect a carbuncle regardless of typical creature limitations. A spell like Charm Person or Hold Person, for example, which typically only affects humanoid creatures, can also affect carbuncles.

Poison Grasp	KEY:Poison Grasp ~ Tatzlwyrm	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DESC:A tatzlwyrm’s breath is poisonous, but rarely fatal.	SOURCEPAGE:pg.82	BENEFIT:A tatzlwyrm’s breath is poisonous, but rarely fatal. While grappling, instead of making a bite or rake attack, a tatzlwyrm can breathe its poison into its victim’s face.

SOURCEPAGE:pg.84	BENEFIT:Thawns find the appearance of themselves and others of their kind revolting. As such, most wear heavy cloaks or otherwise obscure their countenances. All thawns within 30 feet of an uncloaked thawn must make a DC 15 Will save or be sickened for 1 round. This repulsion is all the more severe when a thawn sees its own reflection. Should a thawn be confronted with its own reflection (such as being presented with a mirror) it must make a DC 15 Will save or be sickened for 1d4+1 rounds.
