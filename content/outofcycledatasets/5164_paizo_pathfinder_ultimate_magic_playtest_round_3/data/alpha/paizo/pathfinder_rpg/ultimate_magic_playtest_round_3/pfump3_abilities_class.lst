Armor Proficiency		KEY:Armor Proficiency ~ Magus		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DEFINE:MagusArmorProficiencyLVL|0						DESC:You can cast magus spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a magus wearing medium armor, heavy armor, or a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass magus still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.|PREVARGTEQ:MagusArmorProficiencyLVL,1|PREVARLT:MagusArmorProficiencyLVL,7	DESC:You can cast magus spells while wearing light or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance.

Arcane Pool			KEY:Arcane Pool ~ Magus		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SERVESAS:ABILITY=FEAT|Arcane Strike		DEFINE:MagusArcanePool|0	DEFINE:MagusArcanePoolBonus|0		BONUS:VAR|MagusArcanePool|max(classlevel("Magus")/2,1)+INT		BONUS:VAR|MagusArcanePoolBonus|min(1+((classlevel("Magus")-1)/4),5)		DESC:You have a reservoir of mystical arcane energy that you draw upon to fuel your powers and enhance your weapon. This arcane pool has %1 points. The pool refreshes once each day when you prepare your spells. You can expend 1 point from your arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon you are holding a +%2 enhancement bonus for 1 minute. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5. This ability counts as the Arcane Strike feat for meeting any prerequisites. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves. At 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: dancing, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst, speed, or vorpal. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 of the Core Rulebook). These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time you use this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than you. You can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time. If you use this ability again, the first use immediately ends.|MagusArcanePool|MagusArcanePoolBonus		SOURCEPAGE:p.3
Cantrips			KEY:Cantrips ~ Magus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																DESC:You can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day.

Spell Combat		KEY:Spell Combat Output			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary														DESC:You can cast spells and wield your weapons at the same time. This functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the offhand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, you must have one hand free, while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a full-round action, you can make all of your attacks with ypur melee weapon at a -2 penalty and can also cast any spell from the magus spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action. If you cast this spell defensively, you can decide to take an additional penalty on your attack rolls, up to your Intelligence bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus to your concentration check. If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. You can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but if you have more than one attack, you cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks. You must have one hand free to use this ability, even if the spell being cast does not contain somatic components.

If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. Instead of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, you can make one free melee attack with your weapon as part of casting this spell. If used with spell combat, this does not grant an additional attack.
