		<h1>Main Tab: Summary</h1>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/tabs/summary.png" alt="Main Tab: Summary" /></p>
		
		<p>This is the <strong>Summary</strong> tab. This is the starting point through which the user will build the PC. 
		It is designed to speed up character creation by having the most commonly used aspects available for quick access.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Character Name</strong> field is for the name of the actual character for in play use/reference.</p>
		
		<p>If creating names from scratch is not your forte, you can use the <a href="buttonrandomname.html"><strong>Generate Random Name</strong></a> button and a new 
		window will pop up giving you options to create a new name for your PC.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Tab Label</strong> text field is so you can add to your characters name as well as to change how your characters 
		name appears on the tab labels within PCGen. So if your Character name was Dob Bole, and you added 'The political 
		master!&quot; to the <strong>Tab Label</strong> field, the character output and tab labels within PCGen would display &quot;Dob Bole, 
		The political master&quot;.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Player Name</strong> text field is for your name, so that when the GM has a stack of 50 characters, and he doesn't 
		remember who's character is whose by the character name, it makes their life easier.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Alignment</strong> drop down menu is to select your characters alignment</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Race</strong> drop down menu will not become available until you have chose and alignment and is used for quick 
		access to the races available from the source materials you have loaded.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Class</strong> drop down menu will not become available until you have chosen an alignment and is used for quick 
		access to the classes available from the source materials you have loaded.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Levels to Add/Remove</strong> section contains 3 elements:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>a text field where you can manually enter the level you want, this will not work until you hit the <strong>+</strong> button 
			to add the levels you have entered.</li>

			<li>the <strong>+</strong> button to add levels</li>

			<li>the <strong>-</strong> button to remove levels</li>
		</ul>
		
		  <p>The <strong>Create Monster/Add Kit</strong> button opens the 
		  <a href="../../menupages/file/fileaddkitoptions.html">kit window</a> 
		  allowing you to apply any kits your character qualifies for. As long 
		  as you have not selected a Race the full list of Default Monster Kits will be 
		  available to select from. This is the fast way to create monsters, create a 
		  new character and add a Default Monster Kit.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Race/Class Info</strong> window is merely a reporting window of common information regarding the Race/Class(es) 
		you have.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Character Classes</strong> information window reports what classes you have, what levels in those classes you have, 
		and what source material they come from.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Stat Total</strong> reports how many total character stat points you have used (Starting at zero).</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Modifier Total</strong> reports you total stat modifiers from your characters stats.</p>
		
		<p>The <a href="buttonhp.html"><strong>HP</strong></a> button will bring up the hit points window to edit what your characters hit points.</p>
		
		<p>The <a href="tabability.html"><strong>Abilities</strong></a> button will open up a new window where you can assign/change your Languages, Special Abilities, 
		and Weapon Proficiencies.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Things to be Done</strong> window provides a checklist of, well, things to be done. 
		You will see a clipboard icon on each Tab which has a task which has not been completed. 
		As you complete each item it will be removed from the checklist and the icon will be removed from the Tab.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Statistics</strong> window, will give you a short overview of what your characters abilities are based upon the 
		race and class(es) you have selected.</p>
