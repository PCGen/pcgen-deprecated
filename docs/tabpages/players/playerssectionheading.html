		<h1>Players Walkthrough Section</h1>
		
		<p>This is the starting point for creating a new PC within PCGen.
		Using the tabs that are listed the user will move throughout each one building
		the PC piece by piece until the finished PC is ready to be saved and/or
		exported. Following the tabs in order is the easiest way
		to make sure all sections of the PC are fleshed out and complete.</p>
		
		<p>Each tab is explained fully, and if you have 
		any questions during use of PCGen, you can always use the 'Help on Context' 
		option in the Menu, Help section. Using that option will bring up the 
		exact page in the walkthrough documentation (This documentation) without the 
		screenshot, only the text information, making it easier to match up what you see 
		at the moment.</p>
