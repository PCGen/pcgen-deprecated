		<h1>Main Tab: Spells</h1>
		
		<p>The Spells Tab is divided into three sub-tabs: Known Spells, Prepared Spells and Spell Books.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/tabs/spells_known.png" alt="Sub-Tab: Known Spells" /></p>
		
		<p>The Known Spells sub-tab is used to add spells to the PC's Known Spells lists.</p>
		
		<p>The upper left frame is where you can select which <strong>Class</strong>, and <strong>Level </strong>you wish to be displayed in
		the spells tables below.</p>
		
		<p>Each spell casting class will display a list on the left os all available spells the PC could potentially learn. 
		All spell casters have a <strong>Known Spells</strong> list - in this list are all the spells the caster knows. 
		Spells can be added from the complete spell list on the right in accordance to class limitations.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Wizards can put an unlimited number of spells in their Known Spell lists</li>
			<li>Sorcerers and the like can only add a finite amount</li>
			<li>Some classes (mostly Divine) know all spells automatically so the Class list will match the Known Spells list from the start without the need to add any.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>A spell caster who must prepare spell ahead of time can use the Prepared Spells sub-tab to create Prepared Spell lists.</p>
		
		<p>A spell caster who must record spells in a spellbook can use the Spell Books sub-tab to track which spells are kept in which books.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/tabs/spells_prepared.png" alt="Sub-Tab: Prepared Spells" /></p>
		
		<p>The Prepared Spells sub-tab is used to create lists of spells from the PC's Known Spells lists 
		which represent spells the caster has at the ready.</p>
		
		<p>Spell casters, which can memorize spells, can type in a name in the <strong>Spell List</strong> field and then:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Use the <strong>Add</strong> button to add a new list to the right hand top pane</li>
			<li>Use the <strong>Del</strong> button to remove that list from the right hand top pane</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Only spell casters that memorize spells can create prepared spell lists.</p>
		
		<p>Typical uses of this are for creating a book named
		&quot;Underground&quot; to hold which spells used when in a dungeon-crawl, or a
		book named &quot;In Town&quot; to indicate which spells used when in a town
		adventure.</p>

		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/tabs/spellbooks.png" alt="Sub-Tab: Spellbooks" /></p>
		
		<p>The Spell Books sub-tab is used to track physical spellbooks the spell caster possesses.</p>
		
		<p>If your class uses a Spellbook to record spells in you can use the Spell Books sub-tab to track your spellbooks. 
		First you will need to add one of these items to your inventory. 
		The Spellbook (Wizard's/Blank) and the Blessed Book items are specifically set up for this purpose, 
		when either item is added to your PC's list of equipment they will also appear on the Spell Books sub-tab. 
		It is suggested that you customize the Spellbook (Wizard's/Blank) item 
		to give it a unique name (such as &quot;Merlin's Spellbook Vol 1&quot;) making it easier to keep track of. 
		Once you have a spellbook in your inventory you can add your known spells to it, 
		each spell will take the proper number of pages according to the rules making it easy to know when it's time to buy another spellbook.
