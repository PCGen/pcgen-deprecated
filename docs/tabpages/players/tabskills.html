		<h1>Main Tab: Skills</h1>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/tabs/skills.png" alt="Main Tab: Skills" /></p>
		
		<p>This is the <strong>Skill</strong> tab where the user selects what skills from the list of
		skills loaded from the sources that were chosen when first starting PCGen.</p>
		
		<p>The table in the top left displays the name of the Skill, the cost in skill points
		to choose the Skill, and the source material that the Skill was loaded from.</p>
		
		<p>The table at the top right displays all the skills along with useful bits of information about them such
		as:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Skill</strong></li>
			<li>The current <strong>Modifier</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Rank</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Total Rank</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Cost</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Order</strong></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>A <strong>Cost</strong> of 0 means that you cannot purchase this skill unless in the <strong>Options</strong> tab a non-zero
		cost to these exclusive skills (usually the value is 4 or higher) were assigned.</p>
		
		<p>Once the skill has been selected, right click on the Skill
		and select any of the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Add 1</strong> - adds one skill point to the Skill</li>
			<li><strong>Add 5</strong> - adds five skill points to the Skill</li>
			<li><strong>Add 10</strong> - adds ten skill points to the Skill</li>
			<li><strong>Add n</strong> - allows the user to input a number instead of selecting one of the choices</li>
			<li><strong>Max Ranks</strong> - assigns the maximum number of skill points to the Skill that is possible for that PC</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The bottom right hand window displays skill information on the PC.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Max class skill rank </strong>number shows the maximum amount of skill ranks possible with the current PC</li>
			<li>The <strong>Max Cross-class skill rank </strong>shows the maximum cross-class skill ranks allowed</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The <strong>Include</strong> drop down menu allows the user to select what types of other Skills to display:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>None</strong> - only class and cross-class skills with ranks are displayed</li>
			<li><strong>Untrained</strong> - displays all untrained Skills as well as class and cross-class skills with ranks</li>
			<li><strong>All</strong> - displays all Skills from the source material regardless of it's usability</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><strong>Total Skill points left</strong> is the number of Skill points left
		to be chosen by the user to add Skill points to the PC. When this number
		reaches 0, no more skill points are left to be added for the PC.</p>
		
		<p><strong> Skill points left for class</strong> drop down
		menu displays how many Skill points are available for each class that the PC
		has. If the PC has multiple classes than the drop down menu allows the user to
		choose which class to add appropriate Skill points for.</p>
