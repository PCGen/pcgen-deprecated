		<h1>Submitting a Bug Report for PCGen</h1>
		
		<p>The purpose of this document is twofold:</p>
		<ol class="indent1">
			<li>To provide a walk through of how to properly submit a bug report at Source Forge for PCGen</li> 
			<li>To explain what *IS* a <strong>Bug</strong> and what is a <strong> Feature Request</strong>.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Defining a Bug vs. a Feature Request</h2>
		
		<p>A bug is an error in the program or list files that prevents actual execution of the program or
		the feature you are attempting to use. The distinction can be a little tricky, as
		sometimes a class may not function correctly because all the features that make up 
		that class may not have been implemented into the list files or the code just yet. If a portion of the program worked before, but 
		is now no longer working, there are a number of steps you can follow to decide whether it is a bug or a missing feature.</p>
		
		
		<ol>
			<li>Make sure you have the correct versions of Java (1.5.x is recommended) and PCGen installed
			(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcgen/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcgen/</a> for the latest version)</li>
			<li>Make sure you have the desired Source Materials Loaded</li>
			<li>If you are not sure or can not load the Source Material, 
			please see Part 1 of this FAQ.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>Once the Source Materials are loaded, can you duplicate the problem every time? If you can duplicate it every time, does an 
		&quot;Error Window&quot; appear? (Please note what the error says as it will help in diagnosing/fixing your problem). If there is no 
		&quot;Error Window&quot;, make note of the exact steps you used to duplicate the problem.</p>
		
		<p>If something is missing from the list files, whether it be a class, a feat, or a piece of equipment, THIS IS NOT A BUG. A 
		Feature Request (FREQ) is what is needed (See <a href="faqsubmittingabugreport.html">Submitting a Feature Request</a>) to get the missing information entered into the list files.</p>
		
		<p>Check to make sure that this is not something that may be missing from a list file, If you are unsure how to do this, you can ask for 
		help at the PCGen Yahoo Group message boards
		(<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen</a>), there are any number of people who can tell you what the status of a certain 
		list file may be.</p>
		
		<p>Once you have determined that this is NOT a missing feature from a list file or coding standpoint, the next step is to delete and 
		re-install PCGen.&nbsp; If you have custom Source Material set up, please remember to backup this material in a safe directory.</p>
		
		<p>Once you re-install PCGen, try to duplicate the error. If after a fresh install, 
		the problem still persists, then it's time to enter a Bug Report into Source 
		Forge.</p>
		
		<h2>Submitting your Bug</h2>
		
		<ol>
			<li><p>Go to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcgen/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcgen/</a> 
			and go to Bugs (Either at the top of the screen or scroll down slightly to see &quot;Bugs&quot;.</p></li>
			
			<li><p>Search through the listed bugs at
			(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=25576&#38;atid=384719">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=25576&amp;atid=384719</a>),
			making sure that Assignee, Category, and Group are set to &quot;Any&quot;, that Status is set to &quot;Open&quot;, and that Sort By is set to &quot;ID&quot;, to see if 
			your problem is already submitted. If it is, add a message at the bottom of the bug report detailing your information as well.&nbsp; 
			This will let us know that this is a recurring problem that needs some serious attention.</p></li>
			
			<li><p>If it does not exist, select &quot;Submit New&quot;. Make sure you select the appropriate Category, Group, and make a concise summary of 
			the problem.</p></li>
			
			<li><p>In the Detailed Description, please include the following information:<br />
				<ul>
					<li>Your system configuration (Operating System, total RAM, Version of Java)</li>
					<li>Any Error messages that were returned to you</li>
					<li>Information from the Debug Console</li>
					<li>Any/All steps to reproduce the error<br /></li>
				</ul></li>
			
			<li><p>If the problem is a character file (.pcg) please attach the file so that others can test it and 
					duplicate the problem to fix it.</p></li>
			
			<li><p>Finally, hit submit.</p></li>
		</ol>
		
		
		<h2>Tracking your Bug</h2>
		
		<p>You can go and visit your happy little item any time you please and check on its status. Please note that the item may have been 
		moved to a different tracker group within pcgen (say maybe to data or output sheets).</p>
