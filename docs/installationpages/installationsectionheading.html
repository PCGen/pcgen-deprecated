		<h1>Installation of Java and PCGen</h1>
		
		<p>The following sections describe how to install Java and PCGen Manually for PC, Macintosh, 
		and the UNIX and Linux varieties.</p>
		
		<p>The first section describes the steps for manually installing Java on your specific OS and how 
		to determine what version you may have and which version to install.</p>
		
		<p>The later sections describes how to install PCGen directly from the zip files, and how to upgrade from a previous version.</p>
		<p>As of version 5.8 PCGen is distributed in 4 different versions:</p>
		<ol class="indent2">
			<li>pcgenXXX_full.zip : everything including GMGen and PDF, best installed in new directory.</li>
			<li>pcgenXXX_partial.zip : everything except the GMGen plugins.</li>
			<li>pcgenXXX_win_install.exe : A Windows specific installer.</li>
			<li>pcgenXXX_mac_install.dmg : A Macintosh specific installer.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Where XXX is the version number of PCGen (e.g. 580 for version 5.8.0.)</p>

		<p>The platform specific installers are the same PCGen version everyone else is using, 
		just packaged with installers which target Windows and Mac OSX users specifically. 
		Typically there is a gap between when the official release is done and when these special 
		installers are ready.</p>
