		<h1>Installing PCGen Manually</h1>
		
		<p>If you have PCGen Currently installed on your system, you can either install 
		the new version into a new directory or overwrite the old version currently on your 
		system.</p>
		
		<p><strong>CAUTION! UPGRADING IS NOT FOOLPROOF!</strong></p>
		
		<p>Installing a new version over an old version of PCGen may not run well.  
		See <a href="upgradepcgen.html">Upgrading PCGen</a> for further info.</p>
		
		<p>
			A fresh install is best performed by unzipping pcgenXXX_full.zip to a desired folder on your computer. 
			To run the application, run either pcgen.jar (the Java executable) or pcgen.bat (Windows, which will 
			also open a debug window which will display any errors during the run) or pcgen.sh (UNIX and Linux).
		</p>
		
		<p>To transfer characters from one version of PCGen to the new version of PCGen, 
  		copy the pcg files from the &quot;characters&quot; directory from the old version of PCGen to the new version.</p>
		
		<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you copy PCGen from one location to another you must delete the options.ini file. 
		This file holds directory locations that will no longer be valid! 
		Deleting the options.ini file will reset PCGen to all its default settings.  
		As such, note your current settings before proceeding.  
		A new file will be created when PCGen is started if necessary.</p>
