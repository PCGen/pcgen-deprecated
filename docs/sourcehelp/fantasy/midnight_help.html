	<h3>The Midnight magic system</h3>	
	
	<p class="indent1">Midnight employs an unusual magic system which has been difficult 
	  to implement in PCGen and accounts for the long time it took to appear in the 
	  release. In Midnight any character class can learn and cast spells, they need 
	  only have taken the proper feats. To do this some workarounds are employed to 
	  make this work within PCGen. First all the normally non-spellcasting classes 
	  allowed in Midnight are modified so that they are spell casters. This is only 
	  done for the classes which exist in Midnight, those classes which do not were 
	  left alone. Second the Spells have been modified so that they have as a prerequisite 
	  the correct feats necessary to learn and cast the spell. </p>
	
	
	<p class="indent1">One effect of this is that when the Midnight dataset is loaded 
	  all the spells in the SRD have prerequisites for Midnights requirements which 
	  interferes with spellcasters outside of those in Midnight. If you wish to make 
	  NPC's and monsters with spellcasting capabilities outside of the Midnight system 
	  we have provided a template named <strong>Unlock Midnight Spell Prerequisites</strong> 
	  which will bypass those prerequisites and allow normal spellcasting.</p>
