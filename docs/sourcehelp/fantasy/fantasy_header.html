	<p class="indent1">The 3e and 35e gameModes represent the third edition and the 
	  3.5 edition of the fantasy role playing game published by Wizards of the Coast. 
	  Our datasets are based on the version of this game published under the Open 
	  Gaming License commonly known as the <a href="srd_help.html">Standard Reference 
	  Document or SRD</a>. The rules were recently revised and that version is known 
	  as the <a href="rsrd_help.html">(Revised) Standard reference Document or RSRD</a>. 
	  All of the datasets which appear in the sources tab along with the SRD and RSRD 
	  are dependent on having these loaded and will not function properly without 
	  them.</p>
