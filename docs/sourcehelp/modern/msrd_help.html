	<p>The Modern System Reference Document, or MSRD, contain the core rules for the Modern d20
	  role playing game published by Wizards of the Coast under the Open Gaming License
	  and contain much of the material found in the core book.</p>

	<h2>Loading the MSRD</h2>

	<p class="indent1">To load the MSRD set you always have to load at least the Basics. You have two options
	for that: you can load the complete MSRD Basics set, which contains all the sets from the MSRD &gt; PARTIAL
	&gt; BASICS section, or you can load just the partial Modern Basics set from that section.
	Other than that you can mix and match the complete section sets with the partial sets as you like, but you should
	not load a Complete section set and any of the Partial sets from that very section at the same time
	because it is basically loading the same data twice.</p>

	<h2>General Issues</h2>

	<p class="indent1"><strong>Wealth</strong></p>

	<p class="indent1">The Wealth system in the MSRD is not fully implemented within
	  <strong>PCGen</strong>, though it is fairly easy to work around the limitations. When adding
	  the first level of a base class you are prompted to choose the result of your
	  starting wealth roll which you will need to make manually. This roll is added
	  to any bonuses granted from your starting occupation and/or feats which may
	  effect Wealth and that is your Starting Wealth Score. The starting Wealth Score
	  and Current Wealth Score are displayed on the Abilities Tab in the Special Abilities
	  window and on the Special Abilities Block of the OS. Your Current Wealth Score
	  is displayed in the lower right pane of the Class Tab as well as on the first
	  page of the OS. Since Wealth is fluid and can change based on circumstances
	  within the game a Temporary Bonus exists named Wealth Adjustment which allows
	  you to do exactly that. You will find this in the Temporary Bonus Sub-Tab of
	  the Inventory Tab under Templates. You can apply a modifier from 10 to -10,
	  if you need more or there is more than one adjustment to make you can apply
	  the Wealth Adjustment as many times as is needed. Wealth Adjustment is applied
	  to the Current Wealth Score and leaves the Starting Wealth Score untouched.</p>

	<p class="indent1">Buying stuff. <strong>PCGen</strong> does not yet support the abstract wealth
	  system presented in the Modern rules. As a work around we use the COST attribute
	  to hold the Purchase DC of the item instead of its monetary value. You should check
	  the box marked 'Ignore Cost', consult the Purchase DC of the item and your Current
	  Wealth Score and make your rolls manually.</p>

	<p class="new">*** Updated 5.9.5</p>
	<p class="indent1"><strong>Action Points</strong></p>
	<p class="indent1">Action Points are now granted automatically by the class that
	  provides them. Modification of the Action Points is still done on the <i>Temporary
	Bonus Sub-Tab</i> of the <i>Inventory Tab</i>. There are now two temporary modifiers named
	  <strong>Used Action Points</strong> and <strong>Bonus Action Points</strong>, which can be used to modify a character's
	  Action Points.</p>

	<p class="indent1">The <strong>Used Action Points</strong> tracker is to be applied if you spend Action
	  Points. It records APs as spent and thus reduces the amount of available
	  ones. The <strong>Bonus Action Points</strong> tracker can be used, if you should get Action Points
	  from an unexpected source, like a GM handing out Bonus APs or some House Rule of
	  yours. Your remaining Action Points will then be automatically calculated from the
	  difference of gained and spent Action Points. Both can be applied multiple times.</p>

	<h2>Classes</h2>

	<p class="indent1"><strong>Smart Hero</strong></p>
	<p class="indent1">Because of limitations with the <strong>PCGen</strong> code the Smart Hero's
	<strong>Linguist</strong> talent will not appear as a talent choice at first level. If you want
	to select it at first level anyway, instead of selecting a talent, close the <i>Feat
	Choice</i> window without making a selection, add the necessary ranks in the Read/Write
	Language and Speak Language skills on the <i>Skills tab</i>, and select <strong>Linguist</strong> as one of
	the feats on the <i>Feats tab</i>.</p>

	<h2>Equipment</h2>

	<p class="indent1"><strong>Firearms and Ammunition</strong></p>
	<p class="indent1">Ammunition is sold in bundles, the number of which depends on the type.
	In <strong>PCGen</strong> you will find two versions of each ammo, one is a bundle in which it is sold and one is a single projectile.
	The two versions are identical accept for the name, the Buy DC listed is always for the bundle, you can't buy single bullets.
	The single projectile version exists for the convenience of being able to add an exact amount of these items to the character sheet,
	they will appear on the sheet with check boxes handy for tracking spent ammo.
	You can also load bullets into firearms in the Equipping Tab and checkboxes will appear under the firearms listing in the main Equipment Block.</p>

	<p class="indent1"><strong>Weapon Accessories</strong></p>
	<p class="indent1">Some weapon accessories only make sense when attached to a weapon.
	For that matter the <i>Illuminator</i>, <i>Laser Sight</i>, <i>Standard Scope</i>, <i>Electro-optical Scope</i>,
	<i>Speed Loader</i>, and <i>Suppressor</i> were not included as equipment in <strong>PCGen</strong>, but as equipment modifiers.
	To use one of these items you have to select the weapon you want to apply the item to and customize it.
	To do so, right-click the weapon and select "<i>Create custom item</i>" in the menu. This will open the
	"<i>Item Customizer</i>", where you can select the modifiers you want to attach to your weapon.</p>
