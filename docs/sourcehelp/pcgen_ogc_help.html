	<h2>Equipment Descriptions</h2>
	
	<p class="indent1"><strong>Quiver:</strong> A light leather container with a strap 
	  made for carrying arrows or bolts. Groups of 20 bolts or arrows usually come 
	  in a quiver.</p>
	
	<p class="indent1"><strong>Sheath:</strong> A simple leather container with a strap 
	  made for carrying a single weapon; it can either be worn on a belt for one-handed type weapons or across the back for larger two-handed weapons. </p>
	
	<p class="indent1"><strong>Armor Padding:</strong> This item comes with the purchase 
	  of Full Plate armor.</p>
	<p class="indent1"><strong>Cap (Steel):</strong> This item comes with the purchase 
	  of a Chain Shirt.</p>
	<p class="indent1"><strong>Helmet (Visored):</strong> This item comes with the 
	  purchase of Full Plate armor.</p>
	
	<p class="indent1"><strong>Bracers of Armor +9 and +10:</strong> These items function 
	  exactly like other Bracers of Armor just at a +9 and +10 bonus. They are included 
	  here because the MagicItemsV.rtf document details Bracers from +1 to +8 and 
	  the Epic document details Bracers from +11 and higher. These two fill in the 
	  gap. </p>

	<h2>Starting Funds Kits</h2>
	
	<p class="indent1">The kits will randomly grant an amount of gold to the Gold 
	  field on the Gear Tab which can then be spent purchasing equipment. There are 
	  several kits corresponding to the typical dice used for this purpose. The Starting 
	  Gold kits can be applied as many times as you wish and they will continue to 
	  add more gold to your PC, no cheating ;-)</p>

	<p class="indent2">Starting Funds (1d4 times 10)</p>
	<p class="indent2">Starting Funds (2d4 times 10)</p>
	<p class="indent2">Starting Funds (3d4 times 10)</p>
	<p class="indent2">Starting Funds (4d4 times 10)</p>
	<p class="indent2">Starting Funds (5d4 times 10)</p>
	<p class="indent2">Starting Funds (6d4 times 10)</p>
