		<h1>PCGen Source Help</h1>	
	
	<p>This section will provide information on how to use specific datasets. It is 
	  not intended to detail every aspect of the dataset but is specifically focused 
	  on features and aspects of the dataset which are hidden, obscure, counter intuitive 
	  or simply unimplemented. When it is not obvious how a particular feature from 
	  a source book is handled by PCGen we will include that information here. If 
	  a feature can not currently be supported in PCGen we will use this section to 
	  let you know and include suggestions on how to work around the problem. For 
	  more general instructions on how to use the program you should read the 
	  <a href="../walkthroughpages/walkthroughsectionheading.html">Character 
	  Creation Walkthrough</a> section which includes a step by step tutorial on how 
	  to create a character.</p>
	  
	<p>An example of a feature which would be included in this section is the Arcane 
	  Archer. The Arcane Archer has the ability to enchant any non-magical arrow he 
	  notches in his bow, this feature is not easily done within PCGen data and there 
	  is no way to have it accounted for automatically. The current solution is a 
	  special equipment modifier created for this purpose. To use this feature you 
	  must customize a non-magical arrow and add this equipment modifier to it, it 
	  costs nothing and only grants bonuses to an Arcane Archer but when used by an 
	  Arcane Archer the appropriate bonuses appear on the character sheets. Because 
	  of the unusual (and some what obscure) way this feature is implemented it is 
	  detailed here.</p>
	  
	<p>Another example is a class ability of the Archmage. As the Archmage gains levels 
	  he is given the option to choose a spell he knows and thereafter use it as a 
	  spell-like ability. PCGen at this time does not have the capability to choose 
	  a spell from the characters spell list and display it within the SA text. The 
	  suggested work around is to record your spell choices in a note in the description 
	  tab.</p>
