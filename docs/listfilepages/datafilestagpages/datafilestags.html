	<h1>Tag Listing by File</h1>
		
	<p>The Meat &amp; Potatoes  of it all! The Holy Grail has been found! Houston, we have landed on  the Moon!</p>
	<p> Well, okay, so maybe  not that exciting, but it is as good as sliced bread. A file by file 
		listing of all the tags currently in use by PCGen's list files! How, what, why, where, when... 
		all these questions answered!</p>
	<p>Converting from Code-ese to English is a tough task, so hopefully these pages are a coherent enough form 
		of English for everyone! (and if you speak Code-ese, go away! You're a Code Monkey, this area is for List Monkeys! :p)</p>
