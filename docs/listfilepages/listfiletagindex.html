		<h1>List File Tag Index</h1>

		<p>We have several resources to help those wishing to learn the arcane craft of
		  dataset creation. A good place to start is the <a href="lstfileclass/lstfileclass_heading.html">LST
		  File Classes</a>, they give a good overview of the basics of the dataset structure
		  as well as detailed instructions on coding races. Another good resource is the
		  my_dataset directory in the data folder. This is a framework for a PCGen dataset.
		  It is meant for beginners who want to take their first steps in entering their
		  own custom data into PCGen and have found that the built-in List Editors are
		  too limiting for what they intend to do. It contains some commented out examples
		  and a lot of advice and tips for putting your own sets together. You can get
		  up and running fast by renaming the elements in this set to your suit your needs.
		  Once you start delving deep into LST code you're going to want to keep the
		  <a href="../navlistindex.html">LST
		  index handy</a>, most LST tags have been documented with details on their use.</p>


		<h2>Tag state</h2>

		<p>Some tags are labeled New or Updated as well as Deprecate, Obsolete and Removed. </p>

		<div class="indent1"><div class=alpha><strong>New: </strong></div>New tags usually indicate the version in which they were added to the program.</div>

		<div class="indent1"><div class=alpha><strong>Updated: </strong></div>Updated tags also indicate the version in which they were updated.</div>

		<div class="indent1"><div class=alpha><strong>Deprecated: </strong></div>Deprecated tags are scheduled to be removed from the program. Deprecated tags should still
		parse and work as they did before but will not in future versions. Deprecated tag entries should indicate the tag that replaces it.</div>

		<div class="indent1"><div class=alpha><strong>Obsolete: </strong></div>The tag should still parse but should no longer work.
		Any attempt to load it will display an error message indicating that the tag is no longer supported.</div>

		<div class="indent1"><div class=alpha><strong>Removed: </strong></div>The tag should no longer even parse.
		Any attempt to load the tag should generate an unrecognized tag error the same as any other bad tag name.</div>
