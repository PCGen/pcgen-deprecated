		<h1>Official Release LST standards</h1>
		
		<p>Guidelines for Official Release source submissions.</p>
		
		<p>Please put [SUBMIT] in the subject line when emailing the team with submissions issues.</p>
		
		<p><strong>RULE 1</strong>: Be true to the Source Product (i.e. do not make any judgment calls). If the source 
		doesn't say it, it doesn't go in. It is better to leave incorrect or unclear information out.</p>
		
		<p><strong>RULE 2</strong>: Leave any calls about gray areas to the PCGen Submission Team member.</p>
		
		<p><strong>RULE 3</strong>: Mechanics are NOT to be described. If the final result can be displayed, that is 
		good, but no describing the mechanics behind it on the character sheet.</p>
		
		<p><strong>RULE 4:</strong> Capitalization:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>HARDCODE = ALLCAPS.</li>
			<li>Defined in List files (GameMode or otherwise) = ProperCase.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
		<code>BONUS:COMBAT|AC|5|TYPE=MyType</code></p>
		
		<p>BONUS, COMBAT, AC, and TYPE= are all hardcoded. MyType is defined in the List file (because it just got added!)</p>
		
		<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
		<code>VISIBLE:YES, VISIBLE:NO, VISIBLE:DISPLAY, VISIBLE:EXPORT</code></p>
		
		<p>YES, NO, DISPLAY, and EXPORT are the only valid values of the VISIBLE tag.&nbsp; 
		Since those values and what they do are hardcoded into PCGen, they are done 
		in ALLCAPS in the data files.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Basics:</h2>
		
		<ol>
			<li><p>Plain TEXT file, with a .LST ending for data files, or .PCC for campaign files, instead 
				of .txt<br />
				Use Text editors, such as Wordpad (notepad sometimes has problems with the length of 
				the lines), UltraEdit, Textpad, vi, or ee.<br />
				Microsoft Word has problems with formatting and layout of text, it is not recommended to be 
				used to create files.<br />
				Some LST Monkeys use Excel, and export to a tab delimitated file, which works.</p></li>
		
			<li><p>Tabs between objects. No spaces before or after those tabs. Tab should 
				NEVER be the first character on a line.</p></li>
		
			<li><p>Make sure the first character is either a # (for comment) or a name of the object being defined such as a 
				TAG.<br />
				Tabs and spaces are hard to see, and cause loading issues.</p></li>
		
			<li><p>Set your text editor to 6 spaces per tab, as that is the standard for 
				columnizing the files.</p></li>
		
			<li>Comments on ANYTHING you are unsure about, or haven't been able to implement correctly.<br />
				Comments are always done on their own line, and start with #.<br />
				<ul>
					<li>If you have a suggestion on how to do something, but not totally sure, include that.</li>
					<li>If you have a suggestion on how to do something that would require some code changes, comment on that.<br /></li>
				</ul></li>
		
			<li>Comment line at top of LST files: # Original Entry by: &lt;your name&gt;.<br />
				You want credit for the hard work you've done, right?</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>OGL Compliance</h2>
		
		<p>The Open Game License (OGL) is a royalty free copyright license developed 
    	by Wizards of the Coast. The OGL has revitalized the RPG industry by creating 
    	a way for third party publishers to easily create and publish material they 
    	might not otherwise be free to. Publishers use the OGL to release Open Game 
    	Content (OGC) which can be used by other publishers seeking publish content 
    	based on the original publishers work. Open Game Content is any material that 
    	is distributed using the Open Game License clearly identified by the publisher 
		as Open Game Content.</p>
		
		<p>You can read the OGL <a href="../acknowledgments/ogllicense.html">here 
  		in our documentation</a> or here at <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=d20/welcome">
		Wizards of the Coast's web site</a> which contains additional information about the OGL.</p>
		
		<p>PCGen publishes its data via the OGL. As an OGL publisher we have to insure 
   	 	that the data we publish complies in all respects with the Open Game License. 
    	All data is reviewed for OGL Compliance before being entered into the project 
    	data files.</p>
		
		<p>At this time we only publish Open Game Content. Though not required by the 
    	OGL, PCGen also seeks permission from publishers before including their data 
    	in our releases.</p>
		
		<h2>OGC vs. Product Identity:</h2>
		
		<p><strong>OGC</strong>: For OGL sources, OGC is declared somewhere in the book. It is 
		usually on the title/copyright page (front of book) or the OGL page (usually in 
		the very back). Including that declaration in a separate file with your 
		submission will greatly speed its inclusion into PCGen, since it will give us a 
		quick way of verifying Product Identity to ensure compliance with the OGL on our 
		part.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Product Identity</strong>: For names of objects, use the NAMEISPI:YES tag
		in your submission. For a first submission, please do not include any 
		other Product Identity unless you have discussed it with a PCGen Submission Team 
		member. If you receive a go ahead, follow the restrictions set by it down to the 
		letter.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Other Topics:</h2>
		
		<h3>Copyright (in PCC)</h3>
		
		<ol>
			<li><p>ONLY and EXACTLY what is in the Sec. 15 of the OGL. <strong>VERBATIM</strong>.<br />
				If there are Typos, leave them in.&nbsp; Weird characters, leave them in.&nbsp; Stupid comments, leave them in.<br />
				Including a scanned page from the book with your submission would be nice but not completely necessary.</p></li>
		
			<li>List each source mentioned in the Section 15 in its own COPYRIGHT tag line
				- see Cityscape files (by Battlefield Press) for a superb example.</li>
		</ol>
		
		
		<h3>Names of things</h3>
		
		<ol>
			<li><p>If the name of the object must be different from the source (due to 
				commas or math symbols in the name or other reasons), an OUTPUTNAME: tag 
				with the EXACT name must be included.</p></li>
		
			<li><p>Potions should be listed as Potion (&lt;name&gt;) with OUTPUTNAME:Potion of 
				[NAME] unless the source lists it as otherwise (see part 1 for rules to follow in that case)</p></li>
			<li><p>Poisons, Rods, Staffs, Wands and same way as Potions.</p></li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>File names</h3>
		
		<p>LST file names for PCGen follow a certain naming conventions. You should use 
  		all lowercase letters in the file name. The first part of any file will be a 
  		short version of the source name, for example if the source is named 'The Foo 
  		Handbook' we can shorten it to foohandbook or even fhb. The source name will 
  		be followed by words indicating what type of objects the file contains. These 
  		words are separated an underscore (_) symbol. Using our example here are 
  		some names for a typical source. These are not required but it does help to 
  		quickly identify the contents of the file. This list is incomplete but should 
		give you a good idea of how you should name your files as well as how you 
		should divide up the contents of your dataset. Take a look at other sources 
		that come with PCGen for more examples.</p>

		<h3>SOURCELONG, SOURCESHORT, SOURCEWEB, SOURCEPAGE</h3>
		
		
		<p>SOURCELONG, SOURCESHORT, and SOURCEWEB are defined in both the PCC and the 
 		top of the LST files. These can be easily be changed by the submission team, 
  		so do not feel bad if they are. <b>Note:</b> Prior to version 5.10 SOURCE header 
  		tags were grouped in a single block separated with pipe (|) symbols. This has 
  		been changed to allow for easier parsing, SOURCE header tags should still be 
  		put on one line at the top of the file but should be separated by tabs instead 
  		of pipes.</p>
		
		<p>Formats should be as follows:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><p><strong>SOURCELONG</strong>:&lt;name of publisher&gt; - [&lt;name of product group, if any&gt; - ] &lt;name of product</p></li>
		
			<li><p><strong>SOURCESHORT</strong>:&lt;10 letter or less abbreviation of the name of the product&gt;<br />
				Leave the first name of the product whole, if possible.</p></li>
		
			<li><p><strong>SOURCEWEB</strong>:http://&lt;web address of publisher, or product group if the publisher has a page for that&gt;</p></li>
		
			<li><p><strong>SOURCEPAGE</strong> is done on object lines.<br />
				Use the first page the object is described (so if a class is defined on pages 51-54, the tag would read SOURCEPAGE:p.51)<br />
				Format should be SOURCEPAGE:p.#</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h3>SA</h3>
		
		<ol>
			<li><p>Name ONLY</p></li>
		
			<li><p>Type of Special ability in Parentheses only if mentioned in Source: (Ex) 
				(Su) (Sp) etc. If not mentioned, don't put one.</p></li>
		
			<li><p>If there is a Dynamic formula, and the formula can be calculated, it can be included, but no Formulas 
				described.<br />
				See Monk Stun, and Dragon SA's. If it has a static range (like 10' no matter what) then that should not be 
				listed.<br />
				The user will need to own the source in that case. The dynamic formulas should be done via DEFINE/BONUS:VAR 
				tags.</p></li>
		</ol>
		
		
		<h3>DESC (Feats, Spells, Deities, Domains)</h3>
		
		<ol>
			<li><p>Check for Open Game Content.&nbsp; If the DESC (see below for what to look 
				for) is not OGC, leave as DESC:See text.</p></li>
		
			<li><p>If OGC, for Feats: Use only a 1 line description w/o mechanics. This is 
				best by grabbing the &quot;flavor&quot; line after the feat name but before the 
				&quot;Benefits&quot; or mechanics portion of the feat. This is usually before any 
				prerequisites are listed.</p></li>
		
			<li><p>If OGC, for Spells: Use only a 1 line description that comes with the 
				class spell lists. Some sources have a purely descriptive element for the 
				Spells that are NOT OGC. Consulting with the publisher (and getting 
				permission for the IP/PI) is for the PCGen Submissions Team. Please leave 
				those with See Text, and when submitting the files, include a file with 
				comments such as this, so we know where we stand, and can progress with 
				acquiring permission for the PI or leaving it.</p></li>
		
			<li><p>If permission is granted for closed content PI by the publisher 
				(submission team will inform you if so), then the DESC can be filled in with 
				the same rules as above, but a DESCISPI:YES tag must also be added.</p></li>
		</ol>
		
		
		<h3>DEFINE/BONUS:VAR|</h3>
		
		<p>These two tags are used to track variables across different objects.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li><p>No spaces in the Variable names.</p></li>
		
			<li><p>Full words where possible (no over compressing to the point where it 
				isn't readily understandable to what you are referring to).</p></li>
		
			<li><p>Capitalization: Please use Capitals for the beginnings of words, and 
				lower case for every other letter. For Example: 
				DEFINE:FooClassSpecialAbility|0</p></li>
		
			<li><p>Please use formulas where possible. Such as CL=Name in for class abilities.<br />
				1 Bonus statement with a formula is processed faster than a BONUS statement on ever class line.</p></li>
		
			<li><p>For Variables that will have a BONUS:VAR| in another object than where 
				it is DEFINEd, or if it will be DEFINEd in more than one object, the 
				standard is DEFINE:&lt;name&gt;|0 and leaving all numbers to BONUS:VAR|&lt;name&gt;| 
				statements.</p></li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>DR / Damage Reduction</h3>
		
		<p>This tag is used to track Damage Reduction.  Recent Code enchantments compare different DRs, and list only the highest per type.  This requires some standardization in how DR is coded up, to ensure items are being compared properly.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li><p>Types of DR (after the /) are in Proper Case.</p></li>
			
			<li><p>Numerical DR, as used in 3.0 format is +#</p></li>
			
			<li><p>DR that has no bypass is listed as -</p></li>
			
			<li>Several Key names are used across the datasets.
				<ul>	<li>+1, +2, +3, +4, +5</li>
					<li>Silver, Adamantine, Cold Iron
					<li>Magic, Epic
					<li>Lawful, Chaotic, Good, Evil
					<li>Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing, Ballistic</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
			<li>Use ' and ' and ' or ' between types in the same DR tag.
				<ul>	<li>Bludgeoning or Piercing
					<li>Magic and Silver
					<li>Epic and Evil
					<li>Good or Silver
					<li>Cold Iron or Good
					<li>Lawful or Good
					<li>Bludgeoning and Magic</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
		</ol>
