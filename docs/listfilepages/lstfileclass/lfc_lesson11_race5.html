		</code></p>

		<p>This lesson is intended to cover creating your own &quot;Default Monster Kits&quot;.&nbsp; 
		Default Monster Kits are used to encode the information about the default version of
		a monster as provided in the source material.</p>
		<p>The first thing to note is that a different file set is used when creating Default Monster
		Kits than when creating the monster.&nbsp; The files in question are called &quot;Starting Kits&quot;
		or just Kits for short.&nbsp Kit files have a slightly different syntax than other LST files
		you may already be familiar with.</p>
		<p>The format for a Kit file is each Kit starts with a <code>STARTPACK</code> tag and ends when
		the code sees another <code>STARTPACK</code> tag or the end of file.&nbsp; Most tags in
		a Kit file appear one to a line as opposed to tab separated as in other list files.&nbsp; 
		However, there are some tags which require multiple tags per line and these tags <strong>do</strong>
		need to be tab separated.</p>
		<p>This lesson is not intended as a treatise on Kit files in general.&nbsp; As always, see the 
		documentation for more information on Kit file tags.</p>
		<p>We will revisit our friends the Solar and the Ninja Monkey that we created in the 
		previous lessons on races and use them as examples in this lesson as well.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong><code>STARTPACK</code></strong></p>
<p>This tag defines the name of the Kit and also demarcates the beginning of a new Kit.&nbsp; By convention
we use &quot;Default &lt;Monster name&gt;&quot; as the name for a default monster kit.
<p>The Solar's entry would be: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>STARTPACK:Default Celestial (Solar)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entry for the Ninja Monkey will be:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>STARTPACK:Default Ninja Monkey</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="sidebar"><strong>Update to RSRD</strong><br/>
The Solar is an Angel in the RSRD so our tag would be:The tag in 3.5 would look like:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; STARTPACK:Default Angel (Solar)</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>PRExxx</code></strong></p>
<p>Several items can appear on a <code>STARTPACK</code> line.  One of those things is a prereq
for anyone to be able to take that kit.&nbsp; All global prereqs are allowable on this line.</p>
<p>For default monsters we want to make sure that only a character with a matching race or no race
selected can take the kit.&nbsp; We don't want those pesky Ninja Monkeys selecting our Default Celestial (Solar) kit.</p>
<p>To do this we will add a <code>PRERACE</code> tag to the <code>STARTPACK</code> line we started above.  
So we enter a few tabs and type:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>PRERACE:Celestial (Solar)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, we also want to allow new characters without a race to select this Kit.  To do this we need
to add a new tag to the prereq.&nbsp; To have multiple prereqs we need to use the <code>PREMULT</code>.&nbsp;
To specify that only a character without a race can select the Kit we use the syntax &quot;<code>!PRERACE:%</code>&quot;.
&nbsp; So the final tag for the Solar would be:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:Celestial (Solar)],[!PRERACE:%]</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tag will be very similar for the Ninja Monkey.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:Ninja Monkey],[!PRERACE:%]</code></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>EQUIPBUY</code></strong></p>
<p>This tag is used to set the percentage of list price that creatures applying 
this kit must pay for equipment added through the kit.&nbsp; Monsters are 
generally granted the equipment listed in the race write up for free so we generally want
to set this to &quot;0&quot; meaning the equipment is granted for free.</p>
<p>The code to do this would be (also on the <code>STARTPACK</code> line):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>EQUIPBUY:0</code></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>VISIBLE</code></strong></p>
<p>This tag allows us to control the visibility of the Kit in the user interface.&nbsp;
This tag is also specified on the <code>STARTPACK</code> line. We want anyone who is 
qualified (met the prerequisites we specified earlier) to take the kit to see it so we 
will enter &quot;QUALIFY&quot; as the visibility.  We could also specify &quot;YES&quot;
or &quot;NO&quot; to control the visibility of the kit.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>VISIBLE:QUALIFY</code></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>RACE</code></strong></p>
<p>The next tag we will cover is the <code>RACE</code> tag.&nbsp; As you may have
guessed this allows us to set the race of the character applying the kit.&nbsp; Now 
because setting a character's race to a race it already is can cause problems in PCGen
we want to only set the race if the character doesn't' already have one (all other scenarios
were excluded by the prereqs we entered earlier for the Kit).</p>
<p>This brings up an important point to note, any kit line can be qualified with a <code>PREXXX</code>
tag.&nbsp; In our case we will use part of the prereq we entered for race above.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>RACE:Celestial (Solar)&lt;tab&gt;!PRERACE:%</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tells the program execute this line to set the character's race to Celestial (Solar) only
if the character doesn't already have a race selected.&nbsp; For the Ninja Monkey just 
replace Celestial (Solar) with Ninja Monkey in the above line.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>NAME</code></strong></p>
<p>Generally, we set the name of the monster character to the name of the monster 
exactly as it appears in the source.&nbsp; We use the <code>NAME</code> to accomplish 
that.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>NAME:Solar</code></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>GENDER</code></strong></p>
<p>Sometimes a particular monster always has a certain gender, or no gender at all.&nbsp;
Neither the Solar nor the Ninja Monkey specify a particular gender so we will skip this tag for them</p>
<p>Just to illustrate if you wanted to create a special female version of the 
Solar you could specify &quot;GENDER:Female&quot; on either the <code>NAME</code> line or its
own line.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>ALIGN</code></strong></p>
<p>Next up is alignment.&nbsp; Obviously if the creatures specifies that it is &quot;Always&quot;
a particular alignment you can simply specify that in the Kit and any characters created
using the kit will have the appropriate alignment.</p>
<p>The Solar specified that they are &quot;Always Good (Any)&quot;.&nbsp; We can 
code that in a Kit as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>ALIGN:LG|NG|CG</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will present a chooser to the user when the kit is applied allowing them to select
one of the three specified alignments.</p>
<p>If you remember back to our earlier lesson, we did not all a PREALIGN for the Ninja
Monkey because they were listed as &quot;Usually Chaotic Good&quot;.&nbsp; Since we
are creating a kit for the &quot;usual&quot; case (default) we will specify Chaotic Good
as the alignment for our Default Ninja Monkey.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>ALIGN:CG</code></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>STAT</code></strong></p>
<p>With this tag we can set a character's base stats.&nbsp; For default monsters the
logic is the base stat is 10 unless the value listed in the write up is odd in which case
the base stat is 11.&nbsp; Occasionally, a creature write up will specify that the monster
uses a different set of stats, usually the non-elite array.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to explicitly set each stat a default monster possesses (is not a 
nonability) because otherwise a users preference will be used.</p>
<p>Returning to our examples the <code>STAT</code> line for the Solar would look like:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>STAT:STR=10|DEX=10|CON=10|INT=11|WIS=11|CHA=11</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our Ninja Monkey has stats of Str 17, Dex 18, Con 14, Int 11, Wis 15, Cha 10 so our
stat line looks like:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>STAT:STR=11|DEX=10|CON=10|INT=11|WIS=11|CHA=10</code></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>SKILL/RANK</code></strong></p>
<p>This set of tags, which must appear on the same line, allows you to buy skill ranks
in a skill for the character applying the kit.&nbsp; All of the comments under the section
for <code>BONUS:SKILLRANK</code> apply here as well, except that the workaround for skills
which require a choice is not required.&nbsp; To handle a choice of skills in a default
kit we enter all the choices separated by a pipe character &quot;|&quot;.&nbsp; We then use
the special tag <code>COUNT</code> to specify how many choice from the list the character 
should get.&nbsp; You can specify specific skills or types of skills like <code>TYPE.Knowledge</code>.</p>
<p>The skills are granted exactly as if you had picked them from the user interface.&nbsp; The
character must have sufficient skill points to buy the listed skills.&nbsp; Occasionally a 
source will grant more ranks than the monster can actually pay for.&nbsp; In these cases you
have two options.&nbsp; You can either not grant the ranks and note that the source appears
to be in error or you can use the <code>FREE:YES</code> tag on the <code>SKILL</code> line to
grant the extra ranks for &quot;free&quot; (no skill points will be spent).</p>
<p>The kit will also enforce the user preference for Max Ranks for a skill.&nbsp; Sometimes in
order to get the listed total bonus to a skill it would be necessary to grant more ranks than
the max ranks for a skill.&nbsp; Usually this happens with cross-class skills.&nbsp; To allow 
the skill to go above the maximum you can set the &quot;Bypass Max Skill Rank&quot; setting in
the PCGen preferences.</p>
<p>With all that being said our we would add the following lines to our Solar kit 
(each SKILL/RANK pair should be on a new line, replace <code> TAB </code> with a real tab character):
<blockquote>
  <p><code>
  SKILL:Concentration TAB RANK:11<br/>
  SKILL:Escape Artist TAB RANK:25<br/>
  SKILL:Hide TAB RANK:25<br/>
  SKILL:Listen TAB RANK:25<br/>
  SKILL:Move Silently TAB RANK:25<br/>
  SKILL:Sense Motive TAB RANK:25<br/>
  SKILL:Spot TAB RANK:25<br/>
  SKILL:Search TAB RANK:25<br/>
  SKILL:Spellcraft TAB RANK:13<br/>
  SKILL:TYPE.Knowledge|TYPE.Craft TAB COUNT:5 TAB RANK:25<br/>
  </code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our Ninja Monkey will be very similar:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>
  SKILL:Balance TAB RANK:5<br/>
  SKILL:Hide TAB RANK:5<br/>
  SKILL:Jump TAB RANK:5<br/>
  SKILL:Listen TAB RANK:5<br/>
  SKILL:Move Silently TAB RANK:5<br/>
  SKILL:Spot TAB RANK:5<br/>
  </code></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="sidebar"><strong>Update to RSRD</strong><br/>
The skill ranks for the RSRD versions of the monsters are as follows:<br/>
	<code>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Diplomacy TAB RANK:23<br/>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Concentration TAB RANK:25<br/>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Escape Artist TAB RANK:25<br/>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Hide TAB RANK:25<br/>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Listen TAB RANK:25<br/>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Move Silently TAB RANK:25<br/>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Search TAB RANK:25<br/>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Sense Motive TAB RANK:25<br/>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Spellcraft TAB RANK:21<br/>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Spot TAB RANK:25<br/>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:TYPE=Knowledge|TYPE=Craft TAB RANK:25 TAB COUNT:5<br/>
	</code>
	<br/>
Our Ninja Monkey will be very similar:<br/>
	<code>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Hide TAB RANK:4<br/>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Listen TAB RANK:3<br/>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Move Silently TAB RANK:4<br/>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Spot TAB RANK:3<br/>
	</code>
</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>FEAT</code></strong></p>
<p>The <code>FEAT</code> tag is a very simple one.&nbsp; It simply lists each
feat a creature gets one to a line.&nbsp; The <code>FREE:YES</code> tag can be 
added to the line to grant the feat without charging the feat pool.&nbsp; This would
primarily useful if a creature has more feats than it should for its HD.</p>
<p>Our Solar is fairly straightforward.&nbsp; The code appears below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
	<code>
	FEAT:Cleave<br/>
	FEAT:Dodge<br/>
	FEAT:Great Cleave<br/>
	FEAT:Improved Initiative<br/>
	FEAT:Mobility<br/>
	FEAT:Power Attack<br/>
	</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>GEAR</code></strong></p>
<p>The last set of tags we need to cover to complete our Solar and Ninja Monkey
examples are the <code>GEAR</code> tags.&nbsp; The Solar gets two pieces of 
equipment by default, a +5 dancing vorpal greatsword and a +2 mighty (+5 Str) composite 
longbow.&nbsp; To enter this into the kit we first grant the base item with the 
<code>GEAR</code> tag like so &quot;<code>GEAR:Greatsword</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>Then we need to add the special abilities to the base item.&nbsp; We do this by adding
EQMODs just like using the equipment customizer.&nbsp; For the greatsword we need to
add the following EQMODs, MWORKW, PLUS5W, DANCE, and VORPAL.&nbsp So we will add the
following code to the <code>GEAR</code> line we created earlier: <code>EQMOD:MWORKW.PLUS5W.DANCE.VORPAL</code>.</p>
<p>Now we need to make sure that the item is the correct size for the creature we are
creating.&nbsp; By default, PCGen creates all items at Medium size.&nbsp; Our Solar however
is a Large size creature so we want his greatsword to be Large as well.&nbsp; We can do
this with the <code>SIZE</code> tag.&nbsp; The <code>SIZE</code> tag takes the single
character abbreviation for size or a special tag <code>PC</code> to size the item
to whatever size the character is.&nbsp; We will add the <code>SIZE:PC</code> tag to our
<code>GEAR</code> line to make sure that the Solar's greatsword grows if it does (by 
adding HD).</p>
<p>The last thing we need to do is equip the item.&nbsp; If we do not equip the item
the gear will be added to the character as a possession but will not be used.&nbsp; This
could be useful for items left in the monster's lair but in our case we actually want the
Solar to use its greatsword.&nbsp; To do this we use the <code>LOCATION</code> tag.&nbsp; 
This tag uses the same locations as you would see in the user interface when equipping an item.&nbsp;
A greatsword is a two-handed weapon so it can only be equipped to one place &quot;Both Hands&quot;.&nbsp;
We add the tag <code>LOCATION:Both Hands</code>.&nbsp For items that are not weapons that
can only be equipped to one place on the body (like a ring) you can simply specify 
&quot;Equipped&quot; in the <code>LOCATION</code> tag and PCGen will equip it to the 
correct location.</p>
<p>Now if we put it all together, our kit lines for the Solar's equipment will look
like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
	<code>
	GEAR:Greatsword TAB EQMOD:MWORKW.PLUS5W.DANCE.VORPAL TAB SIZE:PC TAB LOCATION:Both Hands<br/>
	GEAR:Longbow (Composite) TAB EQMOD:MWORKW.BOWSTR|5.PLUS2W TAB SIZE:PC TAB LOCATION:Carried
	</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Well, this brings to a close the lessons on creating monster kits for use 
  in PCGen.&nbsp; There is much more you can do with kits.&nbsp; I encourage you to check
  out the documentation for more in depth information on everything kits can do.</p>
