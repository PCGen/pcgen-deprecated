		<h1>Lesson #9: .lst - Weapon Proficiencies</h1>

		<p class="indent1">The weapon proficiency files are used to set up weapon proficiency 
  			names and the associated TYPES of weapons that they go with.</p>
		<p class="indent1">There is not that much to them so we'll dive right in.</p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Weapon proficiency name</p>
<p>The weapon proficiency file is currently a lst file that has one weapon proficiency 
  entry per line. The first thing on each line is the name of the weapon proficiency. 
  There is no tag for it, the program assumes that whatever is there at the beginning 
  of the line is the name of a weapon proficiency.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>TYPE</code></strong></p>
<p>The TYPE tag is used to set the type/group of the weapon proficiency. This 
  defines for PCGen what type of weapon proficiency it takes for characters to 
  be able to use the weapon. It may take multiple types delimited by periods, 
  (although this is seldom done). The types used are usually Simple, Martial, 
  Exotic or Natural (and are defined in the game mode files).</p>
<p>An example would be TYPE:Martial or TYPE.Exotic. If you wanted to get more 
  specific you could do TYPE:Martial.Sword.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this is the TYPE line that is searched when you 
  use a BONUS:WEAPONPROF=TYPE.yyyy tag. It grants a bonus to a weapon whose 
  associated *weaponprof* has the listed TYPE.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>HANDS</code></strong></p>
<p>The HANDS tag sets the minimum number of hands required to use a weapon. 
  This tag is optional. If it is not present, the default value assumed by 
  PCGen is 1. While 1 and 2 are the standard entries, it would be possible to 
  craft a weapon/weapon proficiency for a creature that had three hands and 
  required all three to wield it properly.</p>
<p><code>HANDS:1</code> and <code>HANDS:2</code> are examples of the use of this 
  tag.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a flag that you may use in this tag that changes it's 
  behavior slightly. That flag is the IFLARGERTHANWEAPON flag, described 
  below</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>IFLARGERTHANWEAPON</code></strong></p>
<p>This is a flag to be used in conjunction with the hands tag. It basically 
  acts as a yes/no switch. If you append this to the HANDS entry, PCGen will 
  compare the size of the PC to the size of the weapon, and grant the 
  proficiency if the pc size is larger than the weapon size, otherwise it will 
  not apply.</p>
<p>This is used for certain weapons that are considered to be exotic 
  proficiencies if used with one hand, but martial if used with both hands. 
  Following is an example of this type of use (putting all of the above 
  information together for you as well):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><br>
    <code>Bastard Sword (Exotic) TYPE:Exotic HANDS:1IFLARGERTHANWEAPON<br>
    Bastard Sword (Martial) TYPE:Martial HANDS:2</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That covers the weaponprof.lst files!</p>
