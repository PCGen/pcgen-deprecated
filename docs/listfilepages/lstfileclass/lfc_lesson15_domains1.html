<p>The domain file is a simple text file with one 'Domain' per
line. There is only one domain specific tag in PCGen so most of the
heavy work in building domains is in the global tags you will use. In
this class I will go over both the domain specific tag as well as a few
of the global tags, organized into two lessons: The Basics, Lesson 15,
covering the tags required to create the basic functionality of a
domain, and The Domain Powers, Lesson 16, that will cover the more
advanced tags that will be used to add the 'Domain Powers' to your
domains. Unfortunately, there are so many variations of global tags
that can be used in any data file, including the domain file, that it
is impractical to go over them all, but I believe that the examples I
will be using in these two lessons, in conjunction with the PCGen
documentation, will give you a jump start on building your own domains.</p>

<p>For those of you that have gone through the previous LST
Classes, some of the global tags will be repetitive. feel free to skip
those portions if you like. These classes are being written for the new
LST-coder, so there will be some overlap, but a student of the classes
does not need to take them in order.</p>

<p>To help you better understand how to put this file together, I
will be using several domains as examples, three drawn from the Revised
Standard Reference Document (RSRD) and one I have made up for this
class in order to more completely demonstrate a few specific global
tags. The domains we'll look at from the RSRD are <em><strong>
</strong></em><em><strong>Law</strong></em>,
<em><strong>Trickery</strong></em> and <em><strong>War</strong></em>,
as well as the new domain of 'Poetry'. Our new domain is presented
below in the standard RSRD format so you can follow along.</p>

<h3>Example Domain</h3>

<h4 class="indent1">Poetry Domain</h4>

<p class="indent1"><strong>Granted Powers:</strong>
You add all <strong><em>Perform</em></strong>
skills to your cleric class skills and automatically <br>

gain the ability to <strong><em>Scribe Scrolls</em></strong>
at 3rd level<strong><em>.</em></strong> You
cast mind-affecting spells at +1 <br>

caster level. and is graced by <em><strong>Great
Intelligence</strong></em> every four levels to a maximum of<br>

20th level. If you have a charisma score of 12 or greater you may use <strong>Ventriloquism</strong>
<br>

once a day as a spell-like ability. </p>

<p class="indent1"><strong>Poetry Domain Spells</strong>
</p>

<ol class="indent1">

  <li><em><strong>Hypnotism</strong></em><strong>:</strong>
Fascinates 2d4 HD of creatures.</li>

  <li><strong><em>Suggestion</em>:</strong>
Compels subject to follow stated course of action.</li>

  <li><em><strong>Geas (Lesser)</strong></em><strong>:</strong>
Commands subject of 7 HD or less.</li>

  <li><strong><em>Modify Memory</em>:</strong>
Changes 5 minutes of subject&rsquo;s memories.</li>

  <li><strong><em>Song of Discord</em>:</strong>
Forces targets to attack each other.</li>

  <li><em><strong>Irresistible Dance</strong></em><strong>:</strong>
Forces subject to dance.</li>

  <li><strong><em>Hold Person, Mass</em>:</strong>
As hold person, but all within 30 ft.</li>

  <li><strong><em>Charm Monster, Mass</em>:</strong>
As charm monster, but all within 30 ft.</li>

  <li><strong><em>Hold Monster, Mass</em>:</strong>
As hold monster, but all within 30 ft.</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Poetry Domain is a
little overdone, but I wanted to demonstrate a number of global tags. I
would not recommend using the Poetry Domain in your campaign, unless of
course you believe the pen is mightier than the sword . . .</p>

<p>A quick note on a few general conventions used within this
class before we jump into it: </p>

<p>1) I have used the angle brackets, 'Less Than' and 'Greater
Than' symbols, to indicate where your text will be entered when
building a domain file. Unless explicitly stated in the text of my
explanation, you will not include the angle brackets in your tags.</p>

<p>2) Coding examples and PCGen tags are identified by <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>
style.</p>

<p>3) When referencing a specific PCGen object, i.e. domain,
feat, weapon, etc., I have included the name as <strong><em>EMPHASISED</em></strong>
text, except for when the object is part of a <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>
example or in the case of the class 'Cleric', which is used throughout
this article.</p>

<p>Without further adieu, lets jump right into the lesson.</p>

<hr>
<p><code><strong>&lt;Domain Name&gt;</strong></code></p>

<p>This is the name used for the domain. There is no specific tag
associated with this entry and it must be the first entry on the domain
line. So, our example domains lines will begin simply enough with the
following entries: </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p class="indent1"><code>War</code>
&lt;tab&gt;</p>

<p class="indent1"><code>Poetry</code>
&lt;tab&gt;</p>

<p></p>

<hr>
<p><strong><code>SOURCEPAGE</code></strong></p>

<p>This tag is as simple as it looks. It identifies the page
within the source material where you can find the specific description,
powers, and spells for the domain you are creating. It takes free-form
text but most often you will find it in one of two forms. If your
source material is an OGL book the format is usually <code>SOURCEPAGE:p.&lt;#&gt;</code>.
If you are working from an online source, such as the RSRD, you would
use the filename, so your tag would look like <code>SOURCEPAGE:&lt;filename&gt;.</code></p>

<p>Since I have created the Poetry Domain from scratch there is
no 'source', so there is no <code>SOURCEPAGE</code> tag
required, but many functions and filters in PCGen use it, so it is good
to include it. Therefore, I will include the tag with an N/A for the
source page. I will skip it. The War Domain on the other hand comes
from the RSRD and therefore would use the <code>SOURCEPAGE</code>
tag per the example below.</p>

<p>Note: There are three other <code>SOURCExxx</code>
tags (<code>SOURCELONG</code>, <code>SOURCESHORT</code>
and <code>SOURCEWEB</code>) that will be covered in a
separate class so we will not be covering them here.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p class="indent1"><code>War</code>
&lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt; <code>SOURCEPAGE:SpellListI.rtf</code></p>

<p class="indent1"><code>Poetry</code>
&lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt; <code>SOURCEPAGE:N/A</code></p>

<p></p>

<hr>
<p><code><strong>DESC</strong></code></p>

<p>Now we are getting to the 'fun stuff'. This tag is a global
tag and is used to provide a simple explanation, or as Professor Baraks
calls it, the 'flavor text', of the powers granted to the cleric by the
domain. These powers can range anywhere from granted feats, spell-like
abilities, or enhancements to any number of skills and abilities. If
you are creating a domain based upon your favorite source book, you can
generally find this information identified as the 'Granted Powers' in
the domain block. For the Poetry Domain listed above and the War
Domain, found in the RSRD, the <code>DESC</code> tags are
reproduced below:</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p class="indent1"><code>War </code>&lt;tab&gt;<code>
DESC:Free Martial Weapon Proficiency with deity&rsquo;s favored <br>

weapon (if necessary) and Weapon Focus with the deity favored weapon.</code></p>

<p class="indent1"><code>Poetry </code>&lt;tab&gt;<code>
DESC:You add all Perform skills to your cleric class <br>

skills and automatically gain the ability to Scribe Scrolls at 3rd <br>

level. You cast mind-affecting spells at +1 caster level. and is <br>

graced by Great Intelligence every four levels to a maximum of 20th <br>

level. If you have a charisma score of 12 or greater you may use <br>

Ventriloquism once a day as a spell-like ability.</code></p>

<p></p>

<hr>
<p><code><strong>SPELLLEVEL:DOMAIN</strong></code></p>

<p>In the domain file this tag provides a list of bonus spells,
and their levels, that the cleric is granted access to by the domain.</p>

<p>There are two types of argument regularly used with this tag,
used in pairs in a pipe (|) delimited list. These arguments are the
domain spell level slot, appearing as <code>&lt;domain
name&gt;=&lt;spell level&gt;</code>, and the name of
the spell that fills that level slot. Together, the string of arguments
will look like this: <code>|&lt;domain
name&gt;=&lt;spell level 1&gt;|&lt;spell name
1&gt;|&lt;domain name&gt;=&lt;spell level
2&gt;|&lt;spell name 2&gt;|&lt;domain
name&gt;=&lt;spell level 3&gt;|&lt;spell name 3&gt;
. . . </code></p>

<p>Using this format, and looking at the spell list for the War
domain, we would code the first level War domain spell this way:
&lt;War=1|Magic Weapon&gt;, with the complete list of spells
codded as seen in the complete example below.</p>

<p>Looking at our sample domain as defined above, the second
example below shows how we would code the domain spells for the domain
of Poetry.</p>

<p>Oh, and one more thing. When listing a spell you MUST use the
name used at the beginning of its entry in the spell.lst file and NOT
its output name. The Poetry domains 3rd level spell, <em><strong>Geas,
Lesser</strong></em> is a good example. The rsrd_spells.lst
file has 'Geas (Lesser)' as the name of the spell with its output name
being <em><strong>Geas, Lesser</strong></em>.
Other incarnations of the <code>SPELLLEVEL</code> tag use
comma-delimited data and including a comma in the domain's spell list
will cause PCGen to ignore the spell reference, thereby not granting
access to that spell as a domain spell.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p class="indent1"><code>War</code>
&lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt; <code>SPELLLEVEL:DOMAIN|War=1|Magic
Weapon|War=2|Spiritual <br>

Weapon|War=3|Magic Vestment|War=4|Divine Power|War=5|Flame Strike|<br>

War=6|Blade Barrier|War=7|Power Word Blind|War=8|Power Word Stun|<br>

War=9|Power Word Kill</code></p>

<p class="indent1"><code>Poetry</code>
&lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt; <code>SPELLLEVEL:DOMAIN|Poetry=1|Hypnotism|Poetry=2|<br>

Suggestion|Poetry=3|Geas (Lesser)|Poetry=4|Modify Memory|Poetry=5|<br>

Song of Discord|Poetry=6|Irresistible Dance|Poetry=7|Hold Person (Mass)|<br>

Poetry=8|Charm Monster (Mass)|Poetry=9|Hold Monster (Mass)</code></p>

<p></p>

<hr>
<h3>Conclusion: The Domain File Entry</h3>

<p>My domain entry now looks like this (all on a single line.):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>Poetry</code>&lt;tab&gt;<br>

  <code>SOURCEPAGE:SpellListI.rtf</code>&lt;tab&gt;<br>

  <code>DESC:You add all Perform skills to your cleric
class skills <br>

and automatically gain the ability to Scribe Scrolls at 3rd <br>

level. You cast mind-affectng spells at +1 caster level <br>

and is graced by Great Inteligence every four levels to a <br>

maximum of 20th level. If you have a charisma score of 12 <br>

or greater you may use Ventriloquism once a day as a <br>

spell-like ability.</code>&lt;tab&gt;<br>

  <code>SPELLLEVEL:DOMAIN|</code><br>

<hr>
<p>Well, that's everything you need to add new domains to your
campaign, albeit, only the most basic of functionality will exist. You
may have noted a number of abilities are included in the <code>DESC</code>
tag that this domain entry doesn't implement. To see how to implement
these abilities, or Domain Powers, we will move to the next lesson.</p>
