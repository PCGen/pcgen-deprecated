<p>This is a continuation of the material presented in Lesson 15,
Domains, The Basics. In this lesson I will go over a handful of global
tags needed to implement the domain powers as described in our sample
domains. As with the previous lesson on domains, I will be using
several domains as examples. Four drawn from the Revised Standard
Reference Document (RSRD) and one I have made up for this class in
order to more completely demonstrate a few specific global tags. The
domains we'll look from the RSRD are <em><strong>Animal</strong></em>,
<em><strong>Law</strong></em>, <em><strong>Trickery</strong></em>
and <em><strong>War</strong></em>, as well as
the new domain of 'Poetry'. Our new domain is presented below in the
standard RSRD format so you can follow along.</p>

<h3>Example Domain</h3>

<h4 class="indent1">Poetry Domain</h4>

<p class="indent1"><strong>Granted Powers:</strong>
You add all <strong><em>Perform</em></strong>
skills to your cleric class skills and automatically <br>

gain the ability to <strong><em>Scribe Scrolls</em></strong>
at 3rd level<strong><em>.</em></strong> You
cast mind-affecting spells at +1 <br>

caster level, and are graced by <em><strong>Great
Intelligence</strong></em> every four levels to a maximum
of <br>

20th level. If you have a charisma score of 12 or greater you may use <strong>Ventriloquism</strong><br>

once a day as a spell-like ability.</p>

<p class="indent1"><strong>Poetry Domain Spells</strong>
</p>

<ol class="indent1">

  <li><em><strong>Hypnotism</strong></em><strong>:</strong>
Fascinates 2d4 HD of creatures.</li>

  <li><strong><em>Suggestion</em>:</strong>
Compels subject to follow stated course of action.</li>

  <li><em><strong>Geas (Lesser)</strong></em><strong>:</strong>
Commands subject of 7 HD or less.</li>

  <li><strong><em>Modify Memory</em>:</strong>
Changes 5 minutes of subject&rsquo;s memories.</li>

  <li><strong><em>Song of Discord</em>:</strong>
Forces targets to attack each other.</li>

  <li><em><strong>Irresistible Dance</strong></em><strong>:</strong>
Forces subject to dance.</li>

  <li><strong><em>Hold Person, Mass</em>:</strong>
As hold person, but all within 30 ft.</li>

  <li><strong><em>Charm Monster, Mass</em>:</strong>
As charm monster, but all within 30 ft.</li>

  <li><strong><em>Hold Monster, Mass</em>:</strong>
As hold monster, but all within 30 ft.</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Poetry Domain is a
little overdone, but I wanted to demonstrate a number of global tags. I
would not recommend using the Poetry Domain in your campaign, unless of
course you believe the pen is mightier than the sword . . .</p>

<h3>Granted Powers</h3>

<p>Before we begin we must first identify which 'Granted Powers'
need to be implemented. Our source for these powers is the text
following the <code>DESC</code> tag. Looking at the Poetry
domain listed above, we get the following powers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Add all <em><strong><strong><em>Perform</em></strong></strong></em>
skills to your cleric class skills.<br>

You may automatically <strong><em>Scribe Scrolls</em></strong>
at 3rd level.<br>

You cast mind-affecting spells at +1 caster level.<br>

Graced by <em><strong>Great Intelligence</strong></em>
every four levels to a maximum of 20th level. <br>

May use <strong>Ventriloquism</strong> once a day as a
spell-like ability (If you have a charisma score of 12 or greater)</p>

</blockquote>

<hr>
<p>Finally, a quick note on a few general conventions used within
this class before we jump into it: </p>

<p>1) I have used the angle brackets, 'Less Than' and 'Greater
Than' symbols, to indicate where your text will be entered when
building a domain file. Unless explicitly stated in the text of my
explanation, you will not include the angle brackets in your tags.</p>

<p>2) Coding examples and PCGen tags are identified by <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>
style.</p>

<p>3) When referencing a specific PCGen object, i.e. domain,
feat, weapon, etc., I have included the name as <strong><em>EMPHASISED</em></strong>
text, except for when the object is part of a <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>
example or in the case of the class 'Cleric', which is used throughout
this article.</p>

<p>Without further adieu, lets jump right into the lesson.</p>

<p></p>

<hr>
<p><code><strong>CSKILL</strong></code></p>

<p>This tag is used to add skills to the cleric's list of class
skills. The new class skills may include a single skill or may be a
pipe (|) delimited list of skills to be added. An example of this is
the <em><strong>Trickery</strong></em> domain
which adds the three skills of <em><strong>Bluff</strong></em>,
<em><strong>Disguise</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Hide</strong></em>
to the Cleric's list of class skills. The first example below gives the
form of this tag.</p>

<p>The skills being added may also be designated by <code>TYPE</code>,
taking the form of <code>TYPE.&lt;skill type&gt;</code>.
Our new domain is a good example of this as the domain adds all <em><strong>Perform</strong></em>
type skills to the Cleric's class skills list. See the example below to
see the tag in action.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p class="indent1"><code>Trickery</code>
&lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt; <code>CSKILL:Bluff|Disguise|Hide</code></p>

<p class="indent1"><code>Poetry</code>
&lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt; <code>CSKILL:TYPE.Perform</code></p>

<p></p>

<hr>
<p><code><strong>BONUS:CASTERLEVEL</strong></code></p>

<p>This tag grants a bonus to the character's caster level. This
bonus is dependent upon specific qualifying parameters, which are
identified within the tag itself. The tag only requires two arguments,
the qualifying tag and the number of levels the caster level is
increased, with a third optional argument in the form of a <code>PRExxx</code>
tag. The general form this tag and its argument take as as follows:</p>

<p class="indent1"><code>BONUS:CASTERLEVEL|&lt;qualifying
tag&gt;|&lt;level bonus&gt;|PRExxx</code></p>

<p>There are several different types of qualifying tags,
including the class name, a spell <code>DESCRIPTOR</code>,
a <code>DOMAIN</code>, a <code>RACE</code>, a
<code>SCHOOL</code>, a <code>SPELL</code>, a <code>SUBSCHOOL</code>,
and a <code>TYPE</code>. Each of these tags, except for
the class name, take the form of <code>&lt;TAG&gt;.text</code>,
with the text being appropriate for the tag, i.e. <code>RACE.Elf%</code>,
<code>SCHOOL.Abjuration</code>, <code>TYPE.Arcane</code>,
etc. The class name is a simple text entry giving the name of the
appropriate class, i.e. <code>Cleric</code>. Looking at
the Domain of Law in the RSRD, the <em>rsrd_domains.lst</em>
file, we find, that a divine spell caster with this domain receives a
bonus when casting lawful based spells. The specific spell descriptor
of 'Lawful' is used in this tag taking the form: <code>DESCRIPTOR.Lawful</code>.
Examining the list of granted powers for the Domain of <code>Poetry</code>
above, we see a divine spell caster with this domain receives a bonus
when casting 'Mind-Affecting' spells. The qualifying tag for the bonus
takes the following form: <code>DESCRIPTOR.Mind-Affecting</code>.</p>

<p>The second argument in our tag is the level bonus. This is a
number, variable, or formula that represent the number of levels that
is added to the divine casters level for the purposes of determining
the effects, DC, etc. In both the domain of <em><strong>Law</strong></em>
and the domain of <em><strong>Poetry</strong></em>,
the bonus level is '1'.</p>

<p>Finally, this tag can take <code>PRExxx</code>
tags, with the most common tag being the <code>PRERULE</code>
tag which checks the state of rule as set in PCGen's 'House Rule'
preferences. The rule must be defined in the <em><strong>rules.lst</strong></em>
file in the 'system/gameModes' folder within PCGen. The particular rule
we are interested in for the BONUS:<code>CASTERLEVEL</code>
tag applies Casterlevel Bonuses from Domains to all Spells and is
referenced by the <code>VAR:SYS_DOMAIN</code> tag, as
defined in the<em><strong> rules.lst</strong></em>
file.</p>

<p>Taking all of this together, the <code>BONUS:CASTERLEVEL</code>
tag for our two sample domains take the form shown below.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p class="indent1"><code>Law</code>
&lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt;<code>
BONUS:CASTERLEVEL|DESCRIPTOR.Lawful|1|PRERULE:SYS_DOMAIN</code></p>

<p class="indent1"><code>Poetry</code>
&lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt; <code>BONUS:CASTERLEVEL|DESCRIPTOR.Mind-Affecting|1|PRERULE:SYS_DOMAIN</code></p>

<p></p>

<hr>
<p><code><strong>PRExxx</strong></code></p>

<p>This tag is a global tag that applies specific prerequisites
to the character before granting the selected domain and its granted
powers and spells. You may include as many of these tags as you like
and each of them will be applied to the domain as a whole. If the
character does not meet ALL <code>PRExxx</code> tags, the
domain cannot be selected. Unfortunately, there are too many <code>PRExxx</code>
tags to go over in this class so I will restrict my coverage to the
most likely tag. That is the <code>PREALIGN</code> tag.</p>

<p>The<code> PREALIGN</code> tag applies an alignment
requirement to the cleric. The form this tag takes is: </p>

<p class="indent1"><code>PREALIGN:&lt;alignment
list&gt;</code>. </p>

<p>The alignment list is a comma-delimited list of alignment
abbreviations as follows: Lawful Good=<code>NG</code>,
Lawful Neutral=<code>LN</code>, Lawful Evil=<code>LE</code>,
Neutral Good=<code>NG</code>, True Neutral=<code>TN</code>,
Neutral Evil=<code>NE</code>, Chaotic Good=<code>CG</code>,
Chaotic Neutral=<code>CN</code>, and Chaotic Evil=<code>CE</code>.
An additional identifier is <code>Deity</code>,
representing the alignment of the characters deity.</p>

<p>Note: The alignments have been assigned specific numbers,
which can also be used. The numbers are: 0=LG, 1=LN, 2=LE, 3=NG, 4=TN,
5=NE, 6=CG, 7=CN, 8=CE, and 10=Deities alignment. These values can be
used instead of the abbreviations </p>

<p>An example of this usage can be seen below for the domain of
Law. As there are no restrictions to be applied, either for alignment
or by any other cr criteria, for the domain of<em><strong>
Poetry</strong></em>, we will not be including a <code>PRExxx</code>
tag in our <em><strong>Poetry</strong></em>
domain line.</p>

<p>As a final note, this tag provides prerequisites that are
separate from the prerequisites used in conjunction with the <a href="../datafilestagpages/datafilesdeities.html#DOMAINS"><code>DOMAINS</code></a>
tag.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p class="indent1"><code>Law</code>
&lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt; <code>PREALIGN:LG,LN,LE</code></p>

<p></p>

<hr>
<p><code><strong>SPELLS</strong></code></p>

<p>This tag grants the cleric spell-like abilities. This tag has
a number of arguments that we will explain below but first, the general
form of this tag and its many arguments are as follows: </p>

<p class="indent1"><code>SPELLS:&lt;spellbook&gt;|TIMES=&lt;number
or formula&gt;|CASTERLEVEL=&lt;number <br>

of formula&gt;|&lt;spell name&gt;,&lt;spell
DC&gt;|&lt;PRExxx tag&gt;</code></p>

<p>The first argument in the <code>SPELLS</code> tag
is the name of the spellbook that the spell-like ability will be
displayed in within PCGen and on the character sheet. This may include
any name you can imagine, though the several examples of this tag in
the RSRD use either 'Innate' or the name of the domain granting the
ability as can be seen in the <em><strong>Animal</strong></em>
domain example given below. It is very important though that the
spellbook name NOT be the same as any Class names, i.e. 'Cleric',
'Sorcerer', etc. Using an existing class name will cause PCGen to throw
an exception and it will not function properly. For our purposes, the
spell book entered is the domain name and takes the form of <code>&lt;domain
name&gt; Domain</code>. For the poetry domain we would enter <code>Poetry
Domain</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>TIMES</code> tag is an optional tag
that identifies the number of times a day the spell-like ability may be
used. If it's not included in the domain line, PCGen will default to 1
time per day. You may enter a specific value, a variable, or a formula
in this tag. It is important to note that within the domain file the <code>SPELLS</code>
tag is not associated with any specific class, therefore, the variable <code>CL</code>
will not work. (For more information about formulas within PCGen, see
the <a href="http://pcgen.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/pcgen/Trunk/pcgen/docs/listfilepages/globalfilestagpages/globalfilesformulas.html">Math
Operators and Formulas</a> section in the PCGen Documentation.) A
special value that may be entered is the value '-1', which will cause
an output on the character sheet of 'At Will'. Both the Animal and
Poetry domains grant spell-like abilities that are usable once per day
so both domain entries will include the <code>TIMES=1</code>
tag.</p>

<p><code>CASTERLEVEL</code> is an optional tag that
sets the level at which the spell-like ability is cast. As with the <code>TIMES</code>
tag, you may enter any value, variable, or formula as desired. If it is
not included, PCGen will default to 1. Only one <code>CASTERLEVEL</code>
tag is allowed in each <code>SPELLS</code> tag entry. For
the <em><strong>Animal</strong></em> and <em><strong>Poetry</strong></em>
domains, we base the caster level on the total level of the character,
including the PC, NPC, and Monster levels but not including any level
adjustments, so we will be using the <code>TL</code>
variable as the basis for the caster level. Unfortunately, there may be
circumstances where the total level is reduced to zero or below, i.e.
with the application of a template that applies negative levels. In
this case, we still want the spell-like ability to function, even if at
a minimum level. Therefore, we will use the <code>max()</code>
formula tag. The entry for the casterlevel for both of our example
domains becomes <code>CASTERLEVEL=max(TL,1)</code>,
setting the caster level of the spell-like ability to the character's
total level with a minimum level of 1.</p>

<p>Besides the spell book, the <code>&lt;spell
name&gt;</code> is the only other mandatory argument for the <code>SPELLS</code>
tag as it provides, as the tag implies, the name of the spell being
granted as a spell-like ability. This spell must exist in the loaded
datasets and must appear exactly as it does in the first position on
the spell line in the spell file. The optional <code>&lt;spell
DC&gt;</code> value may be a number, variable, or formula. I
will establish the DC for the <em><strong>Poetry</strong></em>
domain as <code>12+WIS</code>, meaning a base score of
twelve (12) plus the wisdom modifier. The RSRD gives the DC value for
the <em><strong>Animal</strong></em> domain as
<code>11+WIS</code>, being a base score of eleven (11) plus
the wisdom modifier.</p>

<p>The last argument to discuss is the global <code>PRExxx</code>
tag. These are used to set prerequisites for the spell-like ability
such as alignment requirements or minimum stat requirements. If a <code>SPELLS</code>
tag requires multiple <code>PRExxx</code> statements they
are included as a pipe (|) delimited list at the end of the <code>SPELLS</code>
tag. Some of the <code>PRExxx</code> statements have pipe
(|) delimiting in them, in which case you simply put that <code>PRExxx</code>
statement in a separate <code>SPELLS</code> tag by itself.
The <em><strong>Speak with Animals</strong></em>
ability granted by the <em><strong>Animal</strong></em>
domain does not carry a prerequisite so you will not find a <code>PRExxx</code>
tag attached to the <code>SPELLS</code> tag. The <em><strong>Poetry</strong></em>
domain, on the other hand, does require a minimum wisdom before the <em><strong>Ventriloquism</strong></em>
ability is granted. This prerequisite is coded using the <code>PRESTAT</code>
tag which takes two arguments; 1) the number of stats which must
qualify, one in our case, and 2) the stat and its value, identified by
the stat abbreviation defined in the <em><strong>statsandchecks.lst</strong></em>
file and a numeric value representing the minimum stat value. Our <code>PRESTAT</code>
tag takes this form: <code>PRESTAT:1,WIS=12</code></p>

<p>Ok, so we've gone over all the arguments allowed in the <code>SPELLS</code>
tag. The only thing left to do is put them al together so we can see
the final tag, and this we have done below.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p class="indent1"><code>Animal</code>
&lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt; <code>SPELLS:Animal
Domain|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=max(TL,1)|<br>

Speak with Animals,11+WIS</code></p>

<p class="indent1"><code>Poetry</code>
&lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt; <code>SPELLS:Poetry
Domain|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=max(TL,1)|<br>

Ventriloquism,12+WIS|PRESTAT:1,WIS=12</code></p>

<hr>
<h3><code><strong>VFEAT</strong></code></h3>

<p>The <code>VFEAT</code> tag grants a feat, or a
list of feats, to a character, even if the character would not normally
meet the requirements for that feat. The tag takes a pipe-delimited
list and can be as long as desired, but must contain at least one feat.
The feats included in the feat list must exist and you should NOT use
the feats <code>OUPUTNAME</code>, if one exists for the
feat you are granting. Also keep in mind that some feats have a <code>CHOOSE</code>
built into them, such as <strong><em>Weapon Focus</em></strong>,
while most don't. <em><strong>Weapon Focus</strong></em>,
when applied, calls a chooser to allow the player to choose which
weapon the focus will apply to. Let us assume the character selects the
<strong><em>Longsword</em></strong>, which will
be displayed as <em><strong>Weapon Focus(Longsword)</strong></em>.
This causes some confusion when it comes to listing a feat with a
parenthetical element, i.e. <strong><em>Armor Proficiency
(Heavy)</em></strong>, which is a unique feat with no <code>CHOOSE</code>
command, and the afore mentioned <em><strong>Weapon
Focus(Longsword)</strong></em>. PCGen differentiates
between these two cases by the inclusion, or exclusion, of a space
between the 'open' parentheses and the preceding alpha-character. For a
feat with a built in <code>CHOOSE</code> command, there is
NO intervening space while a unique feat with a parenthetical element
has an intervening space.</p>

<p>As stated before, the <code>VFEAT</code> tag
applies a feat irrespective of the prerequisites for that feat, but the
<code>VFEAT</code> tag also allows the application of new
prerequisites through the use of the <code>PRExxx</code>
tag. The new prerequisite will be applied to all feats listed in the <code>VFEAT</code>
tag. This could cause a problem if you wanted to apply two feats, each
with their own prerequisites, but fortunately, not only can we include
as many feats in the <code>VFEAT</code> tag as we need, we
can also include as many <code>VFEAT</code> tags in the
domain line as we need, each with its own <code>PRExxx</code>
tag. If you browse through the <code>PRExxx</code> section
of the global tag documentation, you will find many tags that can be
used when applying virtual feats, but I will be going over only one of
them here. That is the <code>PRELEVEL</code> tag.</p>

<p>The <code>PRELEVEL</code> tag establishes a
prerequisite for a character to have a minimum number of levels. Its
form is simple, having as a single argument the minimum level required.
The tag takes the following form: <code>PRELEVEL:&lt;minimum
level&gt;</code></p>

<p>With all of this in mind, the form the VFEAT tag takes in this
file, with our selected PRExxx tag, is as follows:</p>

<p class="indent1"><code>VFEAT:&lt;feat
list&gt;|PRELEVEL:&lt;minimum level&gt;</code></p>

<p>For the <em><strong>Poetry</strong></em>
domain, we are applying two feats: the <em><strong>Scribe
Scolls</strong></em> feat, which is granted a third level,
and the <em><strong>Great Intelligence</strong></em>
feat, which normally requires that the character have at least 21
levels. Additionally, we will apply the <em><strong>Great
Intelligence</strong></em> feat several times, specifically
when the character is at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th levels.
Fortunately, the <em><strong>Great Intelligence</strong></em>
feat is stackable so our application of the feat five times as the
character advances from 1st to 20th level can be accommodated by simply
including five <code>VFEAT</code> tags, each with an
appropriate <code>PRELEVEL</code> tag, five time. See our
example below for the final <code>VFEAT</code> tag entries.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p class="indent1"><code>Poetry</code>
&lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt; <code>VFEAT:Scribe
Scrolls|PRELEVEL:3</code> &lt;tab&gt; <code>VFEAT:Great
Intelligence|PRELEVEL:4</code> <br>

&lt;tab&gt; <code>VFEAT:Great Intelligence|PRELEVEL:8</code>
&lt;tab&gt; <code>VFEAT:Great Intelligence|PRELEVEL:12</code>
<br>

&lt;tab&gt; <code>VFEAT:Great Intelligence|PRELEVEL:16</code>
&lt;tab&gt; <code>VFEAT:Greater Intelligence|PRELEVEL:20</code>
&lt;tab&gt;<code> </code></p>

<p></p>

<h3>Conclusion: The Domain File Entries</h3>
