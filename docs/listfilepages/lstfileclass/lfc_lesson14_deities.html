<hr>
<p>The deity files are used to set up and describe the deities
that provide the divine inspiration for your game setting.
Unfortunately, the RSRD does not include any deities and therefore
PCGen does not provide any, at least 'out of the box'. That means you
will have to either create your own deities within PCGen or input them
from any of the many commercial sources available in order to take
advantage of the special powers and spells granted to clerics through
the various deities and the domains they oversee. To that end, with
this lesson I will be showing you the ins-and-outs of deity LST-ing.</p>

<p>The material will be broken down into three sections, the
first of which will introduce you to the basic tags required to create
a useful deity within PCGen, including some tags that are used by PCGen
in files other than the deity file. The second section will cover
additional tags that will help flesh out the detail for your deities,
providing descriptive text that will help identify what the deity is
about as well as in selecting the right one for the character. The
third section will cover the tags used to provide the proper source
identification for the encoded deities. For those of you that have gone
through the previous LST Classes, some of the global tags, especially
the last section, will be repetitive. Feel free to skip those tag
descriptions if you like. These classes are being written for the new
LST-coder, so there will be some overlap, but a student of the classes
does not need to take them in order.</p>

<h3><b>Example Deities</b></h3>

<p>As I stated above, there are no deities listed in the RSRD
from which to draw examples from but there is an example in the
my_deities.lst file which can be found inside PCGen. For additional
examples, and to stay clear of any copyright issues, I have created two
completely copyright free sample deities from which to build this class
material.</p>

<h4 class="indent1"><strong>MoSaT</strong></h4>

<p class="indent1">The CONTENTed One<br>

Demigod<br>

<strong>Pantheon</strong>: BoD<br>

<strong>Symbol</strong>: A Kitten on a Keyboard<br>

<strong>Alignment</strong>: Chaotic Good<br>

<strong>Portfolio</strong>: PCGen Datasets<br>

<strong>Worshipers</strong>: LST Monkeys<br>

<strong>Cleric's Alignment</strong>: NG, CG, CN<br>

<strong>Domains</strong>: Chaos, Knowledge, Animal<br>

<strong>Favored Weapon</strong>: Tiger Claws<br>

<strong>Description</strong>: The great content provider.
He is usually seen as a small<br>

simian stooped over a wireless keyboard typing madly as he travels
<br>

the world setting all knowledge down in the LSTs.</p>

<p></p>

<h4 class="indent1">Thalia</h4>

<p class="indent1">The Flourishing one<br>

Lesser Deity<br>

<strong>Pantheon:</strong> Olympian<br>

<strong>Symbol</strong>: A Shepherds Crook upholding a
Comic Mask<br>

<strong>Alignment</strong>: Neutral Good<br>

<strong>Portfolio</strong>: Comedy, Pastoral Poetry<br>

<strong>Worshipers</strong>: Comedians and Pastoral Poets<br>

<strong>Cleric's Alignment</strong>: LG, NG, TN, CG<br>

<strong>Domains</strong>: Good, Knowledge, Poetry<br>

<strong>Favored Weapon</strong>: Shepherd's Crook<br>

<strong>Description</strong>: The muse of comedy and of
playful and idyllic poetry,<br>

Thalia inspires those so inclined to produce great works of comedy<br>

as well as peaceful, and pastoral, works of poetry. She is sometimes<br>

seen with a crown of ivy and a shepherds crook.</p>

<p>A quick note on a few general conventions used within this
class before we jump into it:</p>

<p>1) I have used the angle brackets, 'Less Than' and 'Greater
Than' symbols, to indicate where your text will be entered when
building a deity file. Unless explicitly stated in the text of my
explanation, you will not include the angle brackets in your tags.</p>

<p>2) Coding examples and PCGen tags are identified by <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>
style.</p>

<p>3) When referencing a specific PCGen object, i.e. deity, feat,
weapon, etc., I have included the name as <strong><em>EMPHASISED</em></strong>
text, except for when the object is part of a <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>
example.</p>

<p>Without further adieu, lets jump right into the lesson.</p>

<p></p>

<hr>
<h3>Section 1: The Basics</h3>

<p>This section will introduce you to the tags required to
implement a simple deity within PCGen. That is, the minimum set of tags
needed to implement a deity within PCGen.</p>

<hr>
<p><code><strong>&lt;Deity Name&gt;</strong></code></p>

<p>The deity file is currently a *.lst file that has one deity
entry per line. The first thing on each line must be the name of the
deity. There is no tag for it as the program assumes that whatever is
at the beginning of the line is the name of a deity. This means that
the entries into our data file begin as follows:</p>

<p><code>MoSaT</code> &lt;TAB&gt;</p>

<p><code>Thalia </code>&lt;TAB&gt;</p>

<p></p>

<hr>
<p><code><strong>DOMAINS</strong></code></p>

<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong> <code>DOMAINS:&lt;domain
list&gt;</code></p>

<p>This tag sets the domains the deity makes available to divine
casters. The text following the tag is a comma-delimited list of domain
names with no spaces included. It is important that the domains listed
must be defined in a <em><strong>domain.lst</strong></em>
file that has been loaded into PCGen. When making your own deity, you
may include as many domains as you wish, though prudence may dictate
limiting the number for if a deity has all domains, which can be done
by simply using <code>ALL</code> as the sole argument,
there is no need for additional deities, and what fun would that be.</p>

<p>The <code>PRExxx</code> tag may be used as an
optional tag added at the end of the domain list, separated by a pipe
(|). These prerequisites are checked against the divine caster to
determine if he/she is allowed to select the domains listed in that
particular <code>DOMAINS</code> tag. Typically, the <code>PREALIGN</code>
tag is used to restrict what alignments a cleric/class with access to
domains can be to have access to the domains. For more depth on <code>PREALIGN</code>
syntax and usage itself, scroll down a bit. It can be used by itself on
the line (with slightly different meaning for the user) and is
explained more in depth there.</p>

<p>PCGen provides some flexibility in how the <code>DOMAINS</code>
tags are applied, allowing some fairly complex application, but most
usage of this tag is fairly simple so you might just skip over the next
paragraph. On the other, if you wish to explore this flexibility, the
following explanation can get you started.</p>

<p>When using the <code>PRExxx</code> tags at the
end of the <code>DOMAINS</code> tag, all domains listed in
that tag will be restricted if the <code>PRExxx</code> tag
isn't satisfied. Fortunately, PCGen allows the placement of multiple <code>DOMAINS</code>
tags in the same deity line, and each <code>DOMAINS </code>
tag can have its own <code>PRExxx</code> tag, or none at
all. With multiple <code>DOMAINS </code> tags, the <code>PRExxx</code>
tags are applied only to the domains included in that specific <code>DOMAINS</code>
tag but all domains included in each <code>DOMAINS</code>
tags are made available to the divine caster, that is if the
appropriate prerequisites have been satisfied.</p>

<p>At this point we are ready to build the <code>DOMAINS</code>
tags for our two example deities.</p>

<p><strong><em>MoSaT</em></strong> is
listed as having the domains of <em><strong>Chaos</strong></em>,
<em><strong>Knowledge</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Animal</strong></em>,
so this tag will appear as <code>DOMAINS:Chaos,Knowledge,Animal</code>.
If we wish to restrict the selection of the <em><strong>Chaos</strong></em>
domain to only those divine casters who are chaotic, we can break the <code>DOMAINS</code>
tag into the following two tags: <code>DOMAINS:Chaos|PREALIGN:CG,CN</code>
&lt;tab&gt; <code>DOMAINS:Knowledge,Animal</code>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Thalia</strong></em> is
listed as having the domains of <em><strong>Good</strong></em>,
<em><strong>Knowledge</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Poetry</strong></em>,
so this tag will appear as <code>DOMAINS:Good,Knowledge,Poetry</code>.
If we wish to restrict the selection of the <em><strong>Good</strong></em>
domain to only those divine casters who are good, we can break the <code>DOMAINS</code>
tag into the following two tags: <code>DOMAINS:Good|PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG</code>
&lt;tab&gt; <code>DOMAINS:Knowledge,Poetry</code></p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<p><code>MoSaT </code>&lt;TAB&gt; . . .
&lt;TAB&gt;<code>DOMAINS:Chaos,Knowledge,Animal</code>
(without the <code>PRExxx</code> tags.)</p>

<p><code></code><code>MoSaT </code>&lt;TAB&gt;
. . . &lt;TAB&gt;<code> DOMAINS:Chaos|PREALIGN:CG,CN</code>
&lt;tab&gt;<code>DOMAINS:Knowledge,Animal</code>
(With the <code>PRExxx</code> tag.)</p>

<p><code></code><code>Thalia</code>
&lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB &gt;<code>
DOMAINS:Good,Knowledge,Poetry
</code> (without <code>PRExxx</code> tags.)</p>

<p><code>Thalia</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . .
&lt;TAB&gt; <code>DOMAINS:Good|PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG</code>
&lt;tab&gt; <code>DOMAINS:Knowledge,Poetry
</code>(with <code>PRExxx</code> tags.)</p>

<hr>
<p><strong><code>ALIGN</code></strong></p>

<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong><code>ALIGN:&lt;alignment&gt;</code></p>

<p>This tag identifies the alignment of the deity. The generally
accepted entries in the text field are <code>LG</code>, <code>NG</code>,
<code>CG</code>, <code>LN</code>, <code>TN</code>,
<code>CN</code>, <code>LE</code>, <code>LN</code>
and <code>CE</code> representing the following alignments:
Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good, Lawful Neutral, True Neutral,
Chaotic Neutral, Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil and Chaotic Evil. This tag
isn't strictly necessary, but is used in <code>PREDEITYALIGN</code>
tag, and a few other places, so we are including it with the critical
tags.</p>

<p>If you examine the stat blocks for our example deities, you
will find each lists an alignment: 'Chaotic Good' for <em><strong>MoSaT</strong></em>,
and 'Neutral Good' for <em><strong>Thalia</strong></em>.
Using the appropriate abbreviations, we get the tag implementations
listed below.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p><code>MoSaT</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . .
&lt;TAB&gt;<code> ALIGN:CG</code></p>

<p><code>Thalia</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . .
&lt;TAB&gt;<code> ALIGN:NG</code></p>

<hr>
<p><strong><code>PREALIGN</code></strong></p>

<p><strong>Tag Format: </strong><code>PREALIGN:&lt;alignment
abbreviation&gt;</code></p>

<p>This tag establishes a restriction, based on the electing
character's alignment, on which deities may be selected. This tag, in
conjunction with the <code>DOMAINS</code> tag, replaces
the functionality of the <code>FOLLOWERALIGN</code> tag,
which, as it has been deprecated, isn't being covered in this class.</p>

<p>The argument for this tag is a comma-delimited list of
alignments by abbreviation. The accepted entries in the text field are <code>LG</code>,
<code>NG</code>, <code>CG</code>, <code>LN</code>,
<code>TN</code>, <code>CN</code>, <code>LE</code>,
<code>LN</code> and <code>CE</code>
representing the following alignments: Lawful Good, Neutral Good,
Chaotic Good, Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral, Lawful
Evil, Neutral Evil and Chaotic Evil. These abbreviations are defined in
the <em>statsandchecks.lst</em> file in the Game Mode
section of the PCGen documentation. There is one additional 'alignment'
which can be included. That is <code>deity</code>, which
simply refers back to the selected deities own alignment.</p>

<p>If you examine the stat blocks for our example deities, you
will find each includes a 'Cleric's Alignment' listed. <em><strong>MoSaT</strong></em>'s
clerics must be neutral-good, chaotic-good and chaotic- neutral while <em><strong>Thalia's</strong></em>
clergy must be lawful-good, neutral-good, true-neutral, or
chaotic-good. Using the syntax described above and the appropriate
abbreviations, we get the tag implementations listed below.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p><code>MoSaT</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . .
&lt;TAB&gt;<code> PREALIGN:NG,CG,CN</code></p>

<p><code>Thalia</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . .
&lt;TAB&gt;<code> PREALIGN:LG,NG,TN,CG</code></p>

<hr>
<p><code><strong>DEITYWEAP</strong></code></p>

<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong> <code>DEITYWEAP:&lt;favored
weapon&gt;</code></p>

<p>This tag provides the deity's favored weapon. This entry is a
pipe (|) delimited list of weapon proficiencies (defined in <em><strong>weaponprof.lst</strong></em>
file, or the tag won't really do anything.) This is included with the
basic tags because, unlike purely descriptive tags, this information is
used in the game mechanics, at least in a minor way. The easiest
example is if a character is a cleric for a deity of war, that being a
deity that has the <em><strong>War </strong></em>
domain as one of his domains, and if that cleric has chosen the <strong><em>War
</em></strong> domain as one of his domains, then
proficiency with the deity's favored weapon is automatically granted.
Note that it is important that any favored weapon for a deity with the <strong><em>War</em></strong>
domain must be included in at least one of the loaded datasets. The
game mechanic is also there for other bonuses and checks to see that
the character has the Deity's favored weapon, but that is more advanced
stuff, so we'll leave for a different class.</p>

<p>Examining the stat blocks for our deities, we find <em><strong>MoSaT</strong></em>
uses 'Tiger Claws' while <em><strong>Thalia</strong></em>
uses the 'Shepherds Crook'. The implementation of this tag for our
deities is shown below.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p><code>MoSaT</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . .
&lt;TAB&gt;<code> DEITWEAP:Tiger Claws</code></p>

<p><code>Thalia</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . .
&lt;TAB&gt;<code> DEITWEAP:Shepard Crook</code></p>

<hr>
<p>Well, this wraps up part 1 of this class. With the info above,
you can create a basic deity and give it enough functionality to bring
it to life for your cleric's, and the party's enjoyment.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Section 2: Filling in the Detail</h3>

<p>In the previous section we covered the minimum set of tags
required to properly implement a deity in PCGen. In this section we
will be covering the tags that are used to flesh out your deities by
providing additional detail. The additional detail is used primarily to
allow for different ways in which to sort the deities during the
character generation procedure, as well as adding flavor to your game.
No game mechanics use these tags directly. You will also find that
these tags are very simple to implement.</p>

<hr>
<p><code><strong>PANTHEON</strong></code></p>

<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong> <code>PANTHEON:&lt;pantheon
name&gt;</code></p>

<p>This tag establishes the pantheon to which the deity belongs.
Examples of these pantheons are the standard racial pantheons (i.e.
Elven, Dwarven, etc.), historical pantheons (i.e. Greek/Olympian,
Roman, Scandinavian/Aesir, etc) or campaign/homebrew pantheons. In
practical use, this tag is used to allow deities to be sorted during
character generation, in this case, by the pantheon that it belongs to.</p>

<p>The deity stat blocks above list the pantheon for <em><strong>MoSaT</strong></em>
as BoD and for <em><strong>Thalia</strong></em>
as 'Olympia', leading to the tag implementation listed below.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p><code>MoSaT</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . .
&lt;TAB&gt; <code>PANTHEON:BoD</code></p>

<p><code>Thalia</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . .
&lt;TAB&gt; <code>PANTHEON:Olympia</code></p>

<hr>
<p><strong><code>TITLE</code></strong></p>

<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong> <code>TITLE:&lt;descriptive
title&gt;</code></p>

<p>This tag provides the deity's descriptive title, providing an
element of storytelling, or flavor to your game. The argument for the
tag is a simple text entry. For our two deities you will find the title
listed just beneath the deity's name, thus <strong><em>MoSaT</em></strong>
is called 'The CONTENTed One' and <em><strong>Thalia</strong></em>
is called 'The Flourishing One'. You can see the implementation of this
tag for each deity below.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p><code>MoSaT</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . .
&lt;TAB&gt; <code>TITLE:The CONTENTed One</code></p>

<p><code>Thalia</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . .
&lt;TAB&gt; <code>TITLE:The Flourishing One</code></p>

<hr>
<p><code><strong>APPEARANCE</strong></code></p>

<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong> <code>APPEARANCE:&lt;descriptive
appearance&gt;</code></p>

<p>This tag provides the deity's descriptive appearance and
implementing it for our two deities is simple. The argument, the
descriptive appearance, is a simple text entry. For our two deities you
will find the appearance included with the general description. Its a
simple matter to review the text and extract the simplest physical
description you can. You can see the implementation of this tag for
each deity below.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<p><code>MoSaT</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . .
&lt;TAB&gt; <code>APPEARANCE:He is usually seen as a
small simian stooped over a wireless keyboard typing madly.</code></p>

<p><code>Thalia</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . .
&lt;TAB&gt; <code>APPEARANCE:She is sometimes seen with
a crown of ivy and a shepherds crook</code></p>

<hr>
<p><code><strong>WORSHIPPERS</strong></code></p>

<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong> <code>WORSHIPPERS:&lt;typical
worshipers&gt;</code></p>

<p>This tag provides a list of the deity's typical worshipers;
whether by class, race, occupation, eye color, speech-pattern, etc. All
text following the tag up tothe next &lt;TAB&gt; or
&lt;RETURN&gt; is assumed to be a descriptive list of these
typical worshipers. This tag is not referenced by anything; it is
purely descriptive.</p>

<p>To implement this tag for our two deities you can find the
typical worshipers listed in the stat blocks identified by the
'Worshipers' label . . . imagine that! You can see the implementation
of this tag in the examples below.</p>

<p>NOTE: The astute student will note that the <code>WORSHIPPERS</code>
tag is misspelled. That may be so but that is the way the tag is in
fact spelled within the program, so please conform to the misspelling
... at least until we can fix it in the code base.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<p><code>MoSaT</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . .
&lt;TAB&gt;<code> WORSHIPPERS:LST Monkeys</code></p>

<p><code>Thalia</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . .
&lt;TAB&gt; <code>WORSHIPPERS:Comedians and Pastoral
Poets</code></p>

<hr>
<p>This completes section 2 of this class material. You can now
fully encode any deity you desire!</p>

<hr>
<h3>Section 3: The Rest of the Story</h3>

<p>If you are building homebrew data sets you can skip this
section, as you will not need the following tags. If, on the other
hand, you are planning on making lots of personal datasets for books
you own they are useful.. If you are building datasets as a PCGen Data
Monkey, they are very important so please bear with me and we'll get
through this as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Note: It is very likely that if you have gone through any of
the other *.lst classes you have seen these tags before and do not need
to suffer through this particular session . . . I promise ninja228 will
not come by in the middle of your next LSTing session to exact
punishment for not reading through it . . . unless of course you
violate the rules of LSTing . . . then your on your own!</p>

<hr>
<p><strong><code>DESCISIP</code></strong></p>

<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong> <code>DESCIP:&lt;YES
or NO&gt;</code></p>

<p>This tag is used to identify the deity description text as
either 'Product Identity' or not. What is product identity (PI)? That's
a very good questions that any lawyer can answer for you for a mere
$150 per hour, unless of course you have abused the same PI, not
recommended, in which case you will likely have to pay a lot more.</p>

<p>PI, in a nutshell, is material that has not been released
under the Open Gamers License (OGL). Inclusion of any PI requires
separate permission from the publisher that owns the material. If you
are coding a deity from a source for the PCGen Project and you have PI,
also called 'Closed Content', that material needs to be identified as
such within the lst file. If you have any questions concerning the
material you are lsting, feel free to consult with any member of
PCGen's OGL Team. They can help to clarify any confusion.</p>

<p>As for this tag itself, it is fairly simple to implement as
the argument for the tag is a simple boolean and will take only <code>YES</code>
or <code>NO</code> as values. For our sample deities, the
first created as an example in the <em><strong>my_deity.lst</strong></em>
file, and the other created out-of-thin-air for this lst class, the
descriptions are not PI; therefore, we would implement this tag as <code>DESCISPI:NO</code>.
Or we would if it was really necessary for if the tag is not included
PCGen defaults to <code>NO</code> so we won't actually
include the tag in our deity file.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong><code>SOURCEPAGE</code></strong></p>

<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong> <code>SOURCEPAGE:&lt;source
page text&gt;</code></p>

<p>Simply put, this tag provides the specific page reference
within the source from which the deity information was taken. The
source page text generally takes the form of <code>&lt;p.#&gt;</code>
with the pound sign (#) being replaced by the page number on which the
deity information can be found within the source material. For our
sample deity <em><strong>MoSat</strong></em>,
the source material is PCGen's <em><strong>my_deity.lst</strong></em>
file so our<code> SOURCEPAGE</code> tag will take the form
of <code>SOURCEPAGE:my_deity.lst</code>. As for <em><strong>Thalia</strong></em>,
our invented-from-thin-air deity, there is no source page, but many
functions and filters in PCGen use it, so it is good to include it.
Therefore, we will include the tag with an <code>n/a</code>
for the source page.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p><code>MoSaT </code>&lt;tab&gt; . . .
&lt;tab&gt;<code>SOURCEPAGE:my_deity.lst</code></p>

<p><code>Thalia </code>&lt;tab&gt; . . .
&lt;tab&gt;<code>SOURCEPAGE:n/a</code></p>

<hr>
<h3>Conclusion: The Deity File Entries</h3>
