		<h1>Loading Campaign Materials</h1>
		
		<ol>
			<li><p>When PCGen starts up it displays the PCGen splash screen.</p>
			
				<p>After it automatically disappears, you will see the PCGen program window and will be on the 
				<strong>Source Materials</strong> tab. [Tabs for the Source Material and Loaded Characters 
				default to the bottom of the screen.]</p></li>

			<li><p>First you should choose your desired Game Mode.</p>
				<p>As of now PCGen supports the following Game Modes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>3.5e - <a href="http://www.wizards.com/D20/article.asp?x=srd35">Revised (v.3.5) System Reference Document</a> (default selection).</li>
					<li>3e - <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/files/3.0%20SRD/">System Reference Document.</a></li>
					<li>Deadlands - <a href="http://www.peginc.com/index.htm">by Pinnacle Entertainment</a></li>
					<li>Legends of Excalibur - <a href="http://www.rpgobjects.com/">by RPG Objects</a></li>
					<li>Modern - <a href="http://www.wizards.com/D20/article.asp?x=msrd">d20 Modern System Reference Document.</a></li>
					<li>Spycraft - <a href="http://www.spycraftrpg.com/">by  Alderac Entertainment Group.</a></li>
					<li>Xcrawl - <a href="http://www.pandahead.com/">by Pandahead Productions</a></li>
					<li>Sidewinder - <a href="http://www.doghouserules.net/">by Dog House Rules</a></li>
				</ul>
				
			<p class="center"><img src="../images/menus/settings_gamemode.png" alt="Choosing Gamemode" /></p>
				
			<li><p>Now you can load sources appropriate to your chosen Game Mode/Campaign.</p>
			
			<p>The Window is broken into 4 panes. The sources <strong>Available</strong> to be used with PCGen, the
				sources you have <strong>Selected</strong> for use in Character Generation, the <strong>Source
				Info</strong> pane and the button pane.</p>
				
				<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/sourcematerial.png" alt="Loading Campaing Materials" width="700" height="600" /></p>

				<p>If you have never started PCGen before, the right hand <strong>Selected</strong> pane will be empty.</p>
				
				<p>The upper-left <strong>Available</strong> frame is a tree of publishers.<br />
				Clicking the &quot;+&quot; sign next to a publisher will expand the tree and show
				the
				subgroups for that publisher.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li><p>When you select a source of interest, the information about the source appears in the lower left 
				<strong>Source Info</strong> frame. </p>
				
				<p>Click the <strong>Add</strong> (&quot;&gt;&quot;) button at the top of the
				upper left frame to add the selected source
				to the <strong>Selected</strong> pane. You can also double-click the source to
				add it. You can also add all sources  from a company or setting by selecting
				the company/setting instead of the product and then clicking the 
				<strong>Add</strong> button or double clicking the company/setting.</p>
				
				<p>If, for instance, you wanted to create a character for the System Reference Document , you would expand the &quot;SRD&quot;, and	select the &quot;3.0 SRD&quot;.</p>
				
				<p>Do this for every source you need to build your character.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the character you want to build requires information
				other than that found in the core player's book, (i.e. it comes from a specific
				campaign world, has a prestige class from a supplemental book, or equipment from a
				magazine article) you will need to load the source which has this information.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li><p>Once all the sources you need are in the upper right <strong>Selected
				</strong>pane, click the <strong>Load</strong> button in the lower right frame. This will load
				all sources in the upper right <strong>Selected</strong> pane.</p>
				
				<p>The Loaded column in the <strong>Selected</strong> pane will then change to
					&quot;Y&quot;</p>
				
				<p>Various pop ups may come up detailing some licensing information and publisher information, 
                just close those (you can also uncheck	the &quot;show at start up&quot; option, so that it only runs once).</p>
				
				<p>You now have the ability to create a new character. </p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p><strong>Optional:</strong> Before creating a character, you may wish to examine
		and/or modify the settings PCGen uses for all characters. This allows certain
		common &quot;house rules&quot; to override official rules for a system. This is 
		under the <strong>Settings-Preferences</strong> menu described <a href="../menupages/settings/settingspreferencesoption.html">here.</a></p>
