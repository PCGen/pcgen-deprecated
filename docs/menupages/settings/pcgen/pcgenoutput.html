		<p>The <strong>Output</strong> option allows the user to select a default <strong>HTML</strong>
		(Used by Print Preview), <strong>PDF</strong> (used by Print) and <strong>EquipSet</strong>
		(generated from the <strong>Inventory</strong>, <strong>Equipping</strong> Sub-tab) output sheets.</p>
		
		<p>It also allows the user to select the paper type, the ability to delete temporary files on exit and toggles the weapon 
		proficiency display in the sheets.</p>
		
		<p>A new addition is the ability to add a command that will be executed after every export (HTML, PDF or others). 
		If you use a % on the command, it will be replaced by the fully qualified name of the file just created by the export.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
		
		<p><code>cmd /c echo % &gt;&gt; exported_files_list.txt</code></p>
		
		<p>This will keep a list of every exported file in exported_files_list.txt in
		your PCGen directory.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Include Skills on Sheet</strong> option allows the user to select 
		which set of Skills will appear on the exported sheet. The default setting is <strong>Untrained</strong> 
		which will output all skills the character has ranks in as well as skills 
		the character may not have ranks in but can be used untrained. 
		<strong>Skills w/ranks only</strong> will output only those skills the character has ranks in. 
		<strong>All</strong> will output all skills from the loaded sources. 
		<strong>Use the option selected on the Skills tab</strong> will default to the option selected on the Skills tab.</p>
