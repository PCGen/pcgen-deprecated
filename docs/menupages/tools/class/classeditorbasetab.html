		<h1>Class Editor: Base Tab</h1>

		<p>The Class Editor is to create you own Classes, edit ones you have already made,
		and in the future will allow you to edit existing Classes (from other data/list
		files).</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Base Tab</strong> has everything required to make a simple Class. The
		remaining tabs are for more advanced Class creation. The Classes created
		will be saved into the data/custom directory under the name of customClasses.lst.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Class Name</strong> is where you will enter the name that you want to print.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Display Name</strong> is where you will enter the name that you want
		displayed in PCGen.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>ABB</strong> is a 3-5 letter abbreviation of the class name.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Ex-Class</strong> is the class to which all current class levels are
		converted if the class prerequisites are no longer met.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Exchange Level</strong> allows the exchange of levels from the current class
		to the specified class.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Has SubClass</strong> flag indicates whether or not this class can choose a
		specialty or subclass.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Mod To Skills</strong> flag indicates monster types that do not get their
		Intelligence modifiers for skills they get from gaining hit dice.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Starting Skill Points</strong> is how many skill points a character gains per
		level.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Qualify</strong> field is a text description that is usually
		  &quot;alwaysValid&quot;.
		It can list exceptions to perquisites.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Multi-Class Pre-Reqs</strong> flag is selected when all Pre-Requisites are
		valid only if the character would be multi-classing into that class (i.e. there
		are no pre-reqs for choosing this as the first class).</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Visible</strong> is a flag that determine whether the class is hidden or not.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Specials</strong> is a | (pipe) and , (comma) delimited tag that is used to
		tell PCGen what special ability the class gets, (Uncanny Dodge|Rogue) the level
		adjustment of the ability ( |0| ) and finally, what levels the class gets the
		special ability at (2,6,11,14,17,20).</p>
		
		<p>The two <strong>Type</strong> windows, <strong>Available</strong> and <strong>Selected</strong> are used to
		create a list of types that the Class is a member of.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Add</strong> and <strong>Remove</strong> buttons will move the highlighted language
			between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on a Type name.</li>

			<li>New Types can be added by manually typing them and then clicking the <strong>Add</strong>
			button</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The <strong>Source</strong> field is a text window for listing what source material the Class
		is from. (If it is a custom created Class, then you can leave this blank or simply put in
		&quot;custom&quot;)</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Product Identity</strong> checkbox is to denote if the Class's name being
		created is the Product Identity of a publisher</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Cancel</strong> and <strong>Save </strong>buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
		to either cancel the Class creation or save it to the customClasses.lst file.</p>
