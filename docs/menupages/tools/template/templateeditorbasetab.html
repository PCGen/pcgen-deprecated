		<h1>Template Editor: Base Tab</h1>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../../../images/editors/template/basetab.png" alt="Template Editor: Base Tab" /></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Base Tab</strong> has everything required to make a simple Template.&nbsp;
		The remaining tabs are for more advanced Template creation. The Templates
		created will be saved into the data/custom directory under the name of customTemplates.lst.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Template Name</strong> is where you will enter the name for your Template.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Visible</strong> option determines whether the template name is hidden in
		PCGen &amp; or the character sheet output. The options are:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Yes</strong> - Shows the Template name in PCGen and on export to a character sheet (This is the default setting)</li>
			
			<li><strong>No</strong> - Hides the Template name in PCGen and on export to a character sheet.</li>
			
			<li><strong>Display</strong> - Displays the Template name in PCGen but not on the character sheet.</li>
			
			<li><strong>Export</strong> - Hides the Template name from PCGen but displays it on the character sheet.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The <strong>Removable</strong> flag determines whether a character can remove a template
		once it has been selected by a character.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Gender Locked</strong> option sets the character's Gender and disables the
		ability to change it.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Wpn Non Prof Penalty</strong> is used to set the character's penalty for non
		proficiency in a weapon to the specified numeric value.
		This can only be a negative number or zero</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Bonus Skill Points / Level</strong> is where you will enter additional skill
		points that your Template receives with each level increase. This happens
		before multiplication of the first class level's skill points.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Bonus Starting Feats</strong> is where you will enter additional feats that
		your Template receives at 1<sup>st</sup> level. These are unrestricted feats.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>CR</strong> is where you will enter the starting Challenge Rating of your Template.
		For CR's less than 1, fractions are used (1/2, 1/4, 3/4).</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Level Adjustment</strong> is where you will enter the Effective Character
		Level (ECL) of the Template.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Size</strong> is where you will enter the size class of your Template. Size
		is used in determining TO-HIT, AC, and affects some skills.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Sub Race</strong> option sets the name of the sub race the character is , the
		default is none. If Yes is <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>specified</span>
		then it will place the name of the template in parenthesis after the race on
		character sheet output.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Sub Region</strong> option sets the name of the region the character is from,
		the default is none. If Yes is <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>specified</span>
		then it will place the name of the template in parenthesis after the race on
		character sheet output.</p>
		
		<p>The two <strong>Type </strong>windows, <strong>Available </strong>and <strong>Selected </strong>are used to
		create a list of types which the template is part of.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Add</strong> and <strong>Remove</strong> buttons will move the highlighted type between
			the 2 windows, as will double clicking on a type name.</li>
			
			<li>New types can be added by manually typing them and then clicking the <strong>Add</strong>
			button</li>
			
			<li>Important for matching up with Monster HD, and for references to race, such as
			the Rangers Favored Enemy.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The <strong>Source</strong> field is a text window for listing what source material the Template
		is from.&nbsp; If it is a custom created Template, then you can leave this
		blank or simply put in &quot;custom&quot;</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Product Identity</strong> checkbox is to denote if the Template's name being
		created is the Product Identity of a publisher</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Cancel</strong> and <strong>Save </strong>buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
		to either cancel the Template creation or save it to the customTemplates.lst
		file.</p>
