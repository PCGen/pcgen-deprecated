		<h1>Deity Editor: Base Tab</h1>
		
		<p class="center"><img  src="../../../images/editors/deity/basetab.png" alt="Deity Editor: Base Tab" width="648" height="494" /></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Base Tab</strong> has everything required to make a simple Class.&nbsp; The
		remaining tabs are for more advanced Class creation. The Classes created
		will be saved into the data/custom directory under the name of customClasses.lst.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Deity Name</strong> is where you will enter the name for your deity.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Holy Item</strong> is where you will enter the name/description of the holy item for the deity.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Deities Alignment</strong> drop down menu is for selecting the deity alignment.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Description</strong> window is where you will type in a description of the deity (i.e. &quot;God of the Dawn&quot;)</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Deity's Favored Weapons</strong> windows, <strong>Available</strong> and <strong>Selected</strong> are used to create a list of all the 
		favored weapons, primarily for use with the War domain. </p>
		
		<p>The weapon names in the <strong>Available</strong> window are drawn from whichever sources were loaded into PCGen. (i.e. If you 
		have SRD and Soveriegn Stone loaded as sources, then weapon names from both sources will appear in the window.)</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Add</strong> and <strong>Remove</strong> buttons will move the highlighted weapon between the 2 windows, as will double 
		clicking on a weapon name.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Source</strong> window, is a text window for listing what source material the deity is from. If it is a custom 
		created deity, then you can leave this blank or simply put in &quot;custom&quot;</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Product Identity</strong> checkbox is to denote if the deity's name being created is the Product Identity of a publisher</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Cancel</strong> and <strong>Save </strong>buttons, which appear on every tab, are used to either cancel the deity creation or 
		save it to the customdeities.lst file.</p>
