		<h1>Deity Editor: Skills Tab</h1>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../../../images/editors/deity/skillstab.png" alt="Deity Editor: Skills Tab" width="648" height="494" /></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Skills Tab</strong> is used to define the skills granted to followers of the deity.</p>
		
		<p>The three <strong>Granted Skills </strong>windows, <strong>Available, Selected Class Skills </strong>and <strong>Selected 
		Cross Class Skills </strong>are used to create a list of class and cross class skills granted to the deity's followers.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The skill names in the <strong>Available</strong> window are drawn from whichever sources were loaded into PCGen. (i.e. 
			If you have SRD and Soveriegn Stone loaded as sources, then skills from both sources will appear in the window.)</li>
			
			<li>The <strong>Add</strong> and <strong>Remove</strong> buttons will move the highlighted skill name between the <strong>Available </strong>window 
			and whichever <strong>Selected </strong>window they are situated next to.  Double clicking has no effect in the skills tab.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The <strong>Cancel</strong> and <strong>Save </strong>buttons, which appear on every tab, are used to either cancel the deity 
		creation or save it to the customdeities.lst file.</p>
