		<p>The <strong>About </strong>option displays info about the release version/date of PCGen, as well as listing 
		the main contributors. There are far too many contributors to list them all here since PCGen is very 
		much a community effort. Info on where to get new releases of PCGen and how to find the PCGen
		community is also provided. Clicking on either of the WWW site or the Email List links will take you 
		to the appropriate web sites that are listed within the button.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Code, List, Test</strong> and <strong>Engineering</strong> tabs will display a list of the contributors 
		by their general Monkey Groupings.</p>
