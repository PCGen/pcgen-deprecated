		<h1>Documentation Standards</h1>
		
		<p>This page will be used to provide standards to follow in the creation of documentation pages for PCGen.</p>
		
		<h2>Documentation Page Standards</h2>
		<p>Each page should have information commented in the page which should contain 
  		the names of those contributing to the creation and maintenance of the page. 
  		There should also be a brief description of the purpose of the page.</p>
		
		<h2>LST Tag Documentation Standards</h2>
		<p>The following is a generic example of the format to be used when documenting LST tags. 
		You can copy the code and use it as a starting point for new entries if you wish. 
		Following the entry will be a detailed explanation of how the format is should be used.</p>
  
		<p></p><hr>
		<p class="new">*** New</p>

		<p class="indent3">Description of what this example tag does.</p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>Where it is used:</strong></p>
		<p class="indent2">Explanation of where this tag may be used in terms of lines and files.</p>

		<h3>Anchors</h3>
		<p>If you examine the source code you will see that the first line of the entry 
			contains a named anchor next to the horizontal rule. This is so the entry can 
			be linked to from the index and other relevant entries. The anchor name should 
			match the tag name up to the first variable minus any symbols used. See the 
			source code for examples</p>

		<h3>State of the entry</h3>
		<p>Some entries are labeled &quot;New&quot; or &quot;Updated&quot;. It is useful 
			to label new tags with the version number that the tag became active.</p>

		<h3>Tag Name</h3>
		<p>The tag name is entered with the whole structure and syntax demonstrated. The 
			variables are indicated using the letter x, y and z. You can use u, v, w and 
			other letters if needed.</p>

		<h3>Variables Used</h3>
		<p>All the variables that can be used are explained. Number variables can be standard 
  		numbers or formulas or other variables if the tags accepts them. Text variables 
  		accept text strings, names and other text forms. Property variables indicate 
  		that the variable must be one of several properties hardcoded into the program. 
		These properties are usually presented in a list following the variable.</p>

		<h3>What it does</h3>
		<p>A complete explanation of the tag and its uses.</p>

		<h3>Example</h3>
		<p>Examples of the tag in as many variations as needed to demonstrate the variety 
			of uses of the tag.</p>

		<h3>Where it is used</h3>
		<p>Some times it may be helpful to indicate exactly where the tag may be used. 
			Most times this is indicated by the page the entry is found on.</p>
