			<li>
				<p><span class="underline">Where are Wizard's of the Coast's books and modules?</span></p>
				
				<p>Those are handled under a special license by the gang at <a href="http://www.codemonkeypublishing.com">Code Monkey Publishing.</a></p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><span class="underline">Where are the Star Wars/Call of Cthulhu/Wheel of Time files?</span></p>
				
				<p>Even though Wizards of the Coast produces those books, they don't own exclusive rights to that material. We'll need to get
				permission from both Wizards and the other copyright owner(s) of said material before we can include them in PCGen.
				It is our intention to acquire this permission, but we're being very careful about how we proceed to maximize our chance of success.
				We'll keep everyone informed when anything worthy of reporting occurs. :)</p>

				<p><span class="underline">How do I include sources from Game Mode X in Game Mode Y that I currently use?</span></p>
				
				<p>It is possible to do this, but you need to understand that this will, more than likely, cause errors due to incompatibility of the game modes..</p>
				<p>To include all of Game Mode X's sources in Game Mode Y.</p>	
				<ol>
					<li>Go to the system/gamemode folder.</li>
					<li>Choose the Y game mode folder.</li>
					<li>Open miscinfo.lst.</li>
					<li>Find the ALLOWEDMODES tag.</li>
					<li>Append '|X' to this line.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Now, all of the sources associated with Game Mode X will show up in Y. Remember, errors are likely doing this.</p>	
				
				<p>To include specific sources from game mode X in game mode Y.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Go to the *.pcc of the game mode X source in question.</li>
					<li>Find the GAMEMODE tag.</li>
					<li>Open miscinfo.lst.</li>
					<li>Append '|Y' to this line.</li>
					<li>Repeat for every source wanted.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Now, all of these specific sources from game mode X will show up in Y. Remember, errors are likely for doing this.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
