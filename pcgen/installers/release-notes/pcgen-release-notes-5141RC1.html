		<h2><a name="WhatsNew">What's new for v5.14.1 RC1</a></h2>

<p>PCGen v5.14.1 RC1 is the first release candidate for PCGen 5.14.1. 
Since the 5.14.0 release we have been hard at work fixing bugs as they are reported. The 
result is a better and more stable character generator for your use.
</p> 
<p><i>James Dempsey</i> for the PCGEN Team -- 30 June, 2008.</p>


		<h2><a name="Chars">Character Changes</a></h2>

		<p>In 5.14.0 we made some major changes behind the scenes to the way special 
			abilities for characters are handled. The benefit is that it lets us 
			model them more accurately, with fighter feats tracked separately to normal 
			feats for example, and that we can output them more accurately on the character 
			sheet or stat block. However there is a downside - this means that there is some 
			migration required for some characters. For details of what you need to do, see 
			the sections for the affected game modes below.</p>
		<p>This revamp of abilities is something we would like your feedback on. So please have a play 
			with them and send your thoughts to the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen">PCGen list</a>.</p>

		<h3>Fantasy Character Changes</h3>

		<p>When a pre-generated SRD (3rd ed) or RSRD (3.5 ed) ranger, archmage or high level rogue 
			character is loaded, it will not recognize
			the selected abilities anymore. For that reason one or more error
			messages will be displayed at character load, which read: "Warning:
			Unable to Find Ability: xxx", where xxx is the name of an ability that
			the character had previously selected.</p>
		<p>To fix this problem, you can take the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Write down the abilities that are mentioned in those error messages somewhere.</li>
			<li>Go to the Feats tab and select the new "Class Abilities" subtab.</li>
			<li>In the lower right corner of the Class Abilities tab you see a drop down
				menu which reads "Rogue Special Abilities". Select the appropriate type of ability 
				for one of the abilities that you have noted. The "remaining" field should now show a
				positive number.</li>
			<li>In the upper left field only abilities that belong to that group will
				be displayed. Select your ability(s) for that group there.</li>
			<li>Repeat for any abilities that were taken from another group.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h4>Monk Character Changes</h4>
		
		<p>The 3.5 Monk present a special problem. The Monk gets to choose specific bonus 
		  feats at levels 1, 2 and 6 and the Monk can ignore the prerequisites of these 
		  feats. As of version 5.14.1 RC1 these selections are made in the Feat tab but previously 
		  they were selected from a pop up menu at level up. The problem is that these 
		  feat selections are virtual feats (since the Monk ignores the prerequisites) 
		  and there is no way to remove previous selections made for pre-existing characters 
		  from within the program. There are two options for dealing with this issue: 
		  You can simply ignore the new feature and retain the previous selections, or 
		  you can edit the character file with a text editor and delete the selections 
		  manually.  A character with levels of Monk will have a feat pool named &quot;Monk 
		  Feat&quot; with 1, 2 or 3 points in it (if no selections have been made), previously 
		  generated characters will still retain their selections and those can be seen 
		  in the feats tab as virtual feats. If you do not wish to make changes you can 
		  set the pool to 0 and simply ignore it. if you wish to delete the previous selections 
		  so that you can choose them through the new feature you will need to manually 
		  edit your characters .pcg file with a text editor, always do this to a copy 
		  of the file in case a mistake is made.</p>
		  
		<p>To edit the Monk:</p>

		<ol>
		  <li>Open a copy of the character in a text editor.</li>
		  <li>Scroll down and find the text <code># Character Abilities</code></li>
		  <li>Under this header find the lines which start with: <code>ABILITY:FEAT|TYPE:VIRTUAL|CATEGORY:FEAT|KEY:</code></li>
		  <li>After &quot;Key&quot; will be the name of the feat, there are only 
			six options: Improved Grapple, Stunning Fist, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, 
			Improved Disarm and Improved Trip. Delete these lines.</li>
		  <li>Save the file and open in PCGen.</li>
		  <li>Go to the Feat tab and make your selections for the Monk Feat pool, 
			these selections will then appear in the general feat pool as virtual feats.</li>
		  <li>Save the character.</li>
		</ol>

<h3>MSRD Character Changes</h3>

		
		<p>When a pre-generated modern character is loaded, it will not recognize previously 
		   selected Talents, Wealth Rolls, Occupations and it's associated selections anymore. 
		   For that reason one or more error messages will be displayed at character load, 
		   which read: "Warning: Unable to Find Ability: xxx", where xxx is the name of 
		   a Ability that the character had previously selected.</p>
		<p>To fix this problem, you can take the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Write down the Abilities that are mentioned in the error messages.</li>
			<li>The Occupation feature is activated via a template that is added when adding a level of any base class, 
				to get this template applied to a pre-generated character you must add a level of a base class. 
				You can add a level and then remove it as well as remove a level and add it back if you need to stay at the current level
				(remember to write down your current experience point value before you level up so you can reset it when leveling back down). 
				If you have more than one base class you will get a pop up chooser window for a template with choices like "FastSkills" or "SmartSkills", 
				choose the template that corresponds to the class taken at level 1.</li>
			<li>Go to the Feats tab and select the new "Background" subtab.</li>
			<li>For most characters you will see an available "Pool" for Wealth and Occupation.</li>
			<li>Select the Wealth Pool and choose a Wealth Roll.</li>
			<li>Select the Occupation Pool and choose an Occupation.</li>
			<li>Once an Occupation is chosen a new pool for that Occupations skill selections becomes available.</li>
			<li>Some Occupations also grant a choice of Feats, these options can be found and selected in the "Feats" subtab.</li>
			<li>Previously selected Occupation Feats will be in the main Feat Pool, see notes below on how to fix this.</li>
			<li>Next select the new "Talents" subtab.</li>
			<li>In the lower right corner of the Talents tab you see a drop down
				menus which reads "Talents". Select a class that one of the talents
				you have noted was taken from. The "remaining" field should now show a
				positive number.</li>
			<li>In the upper left field only Talents that belong to that class will
				be displayed. Select your Talent(s) for that class there.</li>
			<li>Repeat for any Talents that were taken from another class.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The way that the Base classes bonus feats are handled has been changed as well. 
			  Instead of a pop up appearing when the character is leveled up a new Feat Pool 
			  is created on the Feats subtab from which those feats can be chosen. Pre-generated 
			  characters will now have an empty pool for these feats even though they have 
			  already previously been selected.</p>
		<p>To fix this problem, you can take the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Determine which Feats in the standard Feat Pool were chosen as Bonus Feats or Occupation Feats.</li>
			<li>Remove those Feats from the standard Pool and change the number in the Feats Remaining field to 0.</li>
			<li>Select the Bonus Feat Pool and add your Feats back.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2><a name="GMGenIssue">GMGen Known Issue</a></h2>

		<p>There is a known issue with GMGen when used on a Macintosh. In the Initiative
			Tab when running a combat when you select any character other than the one whose
			turn it is and click the Damage or Heal buttons the character whose turn it
			is becomes selected and the damage is applied to him instead of the character
			which had been selected.</p>
		<p>A solution has not yet been found but fortunately there is a simple work-around.
			The problem will only manifest when using the System Look and Feel, you can
			change the Look and Feel by going to Preferences/Appearance/Look and Feel and
			changing it to Java before activating GMGen and then it will work as it should.</p>
