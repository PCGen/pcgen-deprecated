# PCGen

PCGen is a FREE Open Source character generator and maintenance program for role-playing games.

PCGen currently supports the d20 RPG system and includes data sets based upon gaming material from Wizards of the Coast, Paizo Publishing and dozens of other publishers.
The project's current focus is on gaming material released under Wizards of the Coast's Open Gaming License (OGL) and sources supporting the Pathfinder RPG by Paizo, but the PCGen team also works with publishers to get permission to include limited Closed Content as well.
PCGen runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Unix/Linux using Java

# What's new for v6.3.4

PCGen v6.3.4 is our first beta release for the 6.4 cycle! This version has all the 
features we want to put out in our next production release.

From here the focus changes to fixing any issues you report and generally getting 
PCGen polished up ready for production. So please grab a copy, load up your favourite 
characters and let us know how it works for you. In particular please check your 
characters output correctly in preview, html and PDF. We've tested lots of 
combinations but there may still be a few cases where there are output problems. 

## Notable Changes

* Lots of fixes to output
* Many data fixes
* Update Guide to PSOP to recently released 5.0 version
* Improved error handling when exporting characters
* Converter run on all sets
