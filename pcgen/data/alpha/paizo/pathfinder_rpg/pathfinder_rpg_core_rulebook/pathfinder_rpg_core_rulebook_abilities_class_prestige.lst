Enhance Arrow		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:ArrowEnhancement|0	DEFINE:ArrowEnhancementLVL|0	DESC:+%1|ArrowEnhancement	DESC:At 1st level, every nonmagical arrow an arcane archer nocks and lets fly becomes magical, gaining a +1 enhancement bonus. Unlike magic weapons created by normal means, the archer need not spend gold pieces to accomplish this task. However, an archer's magic arrows only function for him. In addition, the arcane archer's arrows gain a number of additional qualities as he gains additional levels. The elemental, elemental burst, and aligned qualities can be changed once per day, when the arcane archer prepares spells or, in the case of spontaneous spellcasters, after 8 hours of rest. At 3rd level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer gains one of the following elemental themed weapon qualities: f laming, frost, or shock. At 5th level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer gains the distance weapon quality. At 7th level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer gains one of the following elemental burst weapon qualities: f laming burst, icy burst, or shocking burst. This ability replaces the ability gained at 3rd level. At 9th level, every nonmagical arrow f ired by an arcane archer gains one of the following aligned weapon qualities: anarchic, axiomatic, holy, or unholy. The arcane archer cannot choose an ability that is the opposite of his alignment (for example, a lawful good arcane archer could not choose anarchic or unholy as his weapon quality). The bonuses granted by a magic bow apply as normal to arrows that have been enhanced with this ability. Only the larger enhancement bonus applies. Duplicate abilities do not stack.

#CLASS:Arcane Trickster (Complete) -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ranged Legerdemain	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:RangedLegermain|0						DESC:%1/day. An arcane trickster can use Disable Device and Sleight of Hand at a range of 30 feet. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by 5, and an arcane trickster cannot take 10 on this check. Any object to be manipulated must weigh 5 pounds or less. She can only use this ability if she has at least 1 rank in the skill being used.|RangedLegermain
Impromptu Sneak Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:ImpromptuSneak|0							DESC:%1/day. Beginning at 3rd level, once per day an arcane trickster can declare one melee or ranged attack she makes to be a sneak attack (the target can be no more than 30 feet distant if the impromptu sneak attack is a ranged attack). The target of an impromptu sneak attack loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, but only against that attack. The power can be used against any target, but creatures that are not subject to critical hits take no extra damage (though they still lose any Dexterity bonus to AC against the attack). At 7th level, an arcane trickster can use this ability twice per day.|ImpromptuSneak
Tricky Spells		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality					DEFINE:TrickySpells|0							DESC:Starting at 5th level, an arcane trickster can cast her spells without their somatic or verbal components, as if using the Still Spell and Silent Spell feats. Spells cast using this ability do not increase in spell level or casting time. She can use this ability 3 times per day at 5th level and one additional time per every two levels thereafter, to a maximum of 5 times per day at 9th level. The arcane trickster decides to use this ability at the time of casting.
Invisible Thief		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality															DESC:At 9th level, an arcane trickster can become invisible, as if under the effects of greater invisibility, as a free action. She can remain invisible for a number of rounds per day equal to her arcane trickster level. Her caster level for this effect is equal to her caster level. These rounds need not be consecutive.
Surprise Spells		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality															DESC:At 10th level, an arcane trickster can add her sneak attack damage to any spell that deals damage, if the targets are f lat-footed. This additional damage only applies to spells that deal hit point damage, and the additional damage is of the same type as the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw to negate or halve the damage, it also negates or halves the sneak attack damage.

Death Attack				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack			VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:DeathAttack|0		DESC:DC %1|DeathAttack	DESC:If an assassin studies his victim for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (assassin's choice). Studying the victim is a standard action. The death attack fails if the target detects the assassin or recognizes the assassin as an enemy (although the attack might still be a sneak attack if the target is deniedhis Dexterity bonus to his Armor Class or is f lanked). If the victim of such a death attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the assassin's class level + the assassin's Int modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the assassin.

Hidden Weapons				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary								DESC:At 4th level, an assassin becomes a master at hiding weapons on his body. He adds his assassin level to all Sleight of Hand skill checks made to prevent others from noticing them.
True Death					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:Starting at 4th level, anyone slain by an assassin's death attack becomes more difficult to bring back from the dead. Spellcasters attempting to bring a creature back from the dead using raise dead or similar magic must make a caster level check with a DC equal to 15 + the assassin's level or the spell fails and the material component is wasted. Casting remove curse the round before attempting to bring the creature back from the dead negates this chance. The DC of the remove curse is 10 + the assassin's level.
Quiet Death					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary								DESC:At 6th level, whenever an assassin kills a creature using his death attack during a surprise round, he can also make a Stealth check, opposed by Perception checks of those in the vicinity to prevent them from identifying him as the assailant. If successful, those nearby might not even notice that the target is dead for a few moments, allowing the assassin to avoid detection.
Swift Death					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary								DESC:At 9th level, once per day, an assassin can make a death attack against a foe without studying the foe beforehand. He must still sneak attack his foe using a melee weapon that deals damage.
Angel of Death				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural								DESC:At 10th level, the assassin becomes a master of death. Once per day, when the assassin makes a successful death attack, he can cause the target's body to crumble to dust. This prevents raise dead and resurrection (although true resurrection works as normal). The assassin must declare the use of this ability before the attack is made. If the attack misses or the target successfully saves against the death attack, this ability is wasted with no effect.

Blood of Dragons		KEY:Blood of Dragons ~ DD		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality												DESC:A dragon disciple adds his level to his sorcerer levels when determining the powers gained from his bloodline. If the dragon disciple does not have levels of sorcerer, he instead gains bloodline powers of the draconic bloodline, using his dragon disciple level as his sorcerer level to determine the bonuses gained. He must choose a dragon type upon gaining his first level in this class and that type must be the same as his sorcerer type. This ability does not grant bonus spells to a sorcerer unless he possesses spell slots of an appropriate level. Such bonus spells are automatically granted if the sorcerer gains spell slots of the spell's level.

Natural Armor Increase	KEY:Natural Armor Increase ~ DD	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DEFINE:DragonDiscipleArmorBonus|0				DESC:As his skin thickens, a dragon disciple takes on more and more of his progenitor's physical aspect. At 1st, 4th, and 7th level, a dragon disciple gains an increase to the character's existing natural armor (if any), as indicated on Table 11–4. These armor bonuses stack. Ability Boost (Ex): As a dragon disciple gains levels in this prestige class, his ability scores increase as noted on Table 11–4. These increases stack and are gained as if through level advancement.
Dragon Bite			KEY:Dragon Bite ~ DD			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary										DESC:At 2nd level, whenever the dragon disciple uses his bloodline to grow claws, he also gains a bite attack. This natural attack is made at the dragon disciple's full base attack bonus. The dragon disciple adds 1–1/2 times his Strength modif ier on damage rolls made with his bite. Upon reaching 6th level, this bite also deals 1d6 points of energy damage. The type of damage dealt is determined by the dragon disciple's bloodline.
Breath Weapon		KEY:Breath Weapon ~ DD			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DEFINE:BreathWeaponDC|0	DEFINE:BreathWeaponDice|0	DESC:At 3rd level, a dragon disciple gains the breath weapon bloodline power, even if his level does not yet grant that power. Once his level is highenough to grant this ability through the bloodline, the dragon disciple gains an additional use of his breath weapon each day. The type and shape of the breath weapon depends on the type of dragon selected by the dragon disciple, as detailed under the Draconic sorcerer bloodline description (see page 75).																																																																																										BONUS:VAR|BreathWeaponDC|10+CL+CON
Blindsense			KEY:Blindsense ~ DD			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary										DESC:At 5th level, the dragon disciple gains blindsense with a range of 30 feet. Using nonvisual senses the dragon disciple notices things he cannot see. Heusually does not need to make Perception checks to notice and pinpoint the location of creatures within range of his blindsense ability, provided that he has line of effect (see page 215) to that creature. Any opponent the dragon disciple cannot see still has total concealment against him, and the dragon disciple still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes thathave concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see. At 10th level, the range of this ability increases to 60 feet.
Dragon Form			KEY:Dragon Form ~ DD			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.SpellLike											DESC:At 7th level, a dragon disciple can assume the form of a dragon. This ability works like form of the dragon I. At 10th level, this ability functions as form of the dragon II and the dragon disciple can use this ability twice per day. His caster level for this effect is equal to his effective sorcerer levels for his draconic bloodline. Whenever he casts form of the dragon, he must assume the form of a dragon of the same type as his bloodline.
Dragon Wings		KEY:Dragon Wings ~ DD			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary										DESC:At 9th level, a dragon disciple gains the wings bloodline power, even if his level does not yet grant that power. Once his level is high enough to grant this ability through the bloodline, the dragon disciple's speed increases to 90 feet.

Whenever the duelist takes a full attack action with a light or onehanded piercing weapon, she can elect not to take one of her attacks. At any time before her next turn, she can attempt to parry an attack against her or an adjacent ally as an immediate action. To parry the attack, the duelist makes an attack roll, using the same bonuses as the attack she chose to forego during her previous action. If her attack roll is greater than the roll of the attacking creature, the attack automatically misses. For each size category that the attacking creature is larger than the duelist, the duelist takes a –4 penalty on her attack roll. The duelist also takes a –4 penalty when attempting to parry an attack made against an adjacent ally. The duelist must declare the use of this ability after the attack is announced, but before the roll is made.
Riposte								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary												DESC:Starting at 5th level, a duelist can make an attack of opportunity against any creature whose attack she successfully parries, so long as the creature she is attacking is within reach.

###Block: Pathfinder Chronicler -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Ability Name		Unique Key				Category of Ability		Type						Define				Description
Bardic Music		KEY:Bardic Music ~ PFC		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:At 3rd level, a Pathfinder chronicler gains this ability, which functions like the bard class feature of the same name, except that the chronicler's effective bard level is 2 lower than her class level. Levels in this class stack with levels in any other class that grants a similar ability to determine her effective bard level.
Deep Pockets							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:A Pathfinder chronicler collects items as well as lore, picking up small amounts of this or that throughout her travels. As a result, she may carry unspecif ied equipment worth up to 100 gp per class level. This can be any kind of gear that can reasonably f it into a backpack, including potions and scrolls (but not any other sort of magic item). As a full-round action, the chronicler may dig through her pockets to retrieve an item she specif ies at that time, deducting its value from the allocated amount of cost. This item cannot weigh more than 10 pounds. When the total remaining cost reaches 0, the chronicler can retrieve no more items until she ref ills her deep pockets by spending a few hours and an amount of gold to bring her total up to 100 gp per class level. In addition, if she takes 1 hour to pack her gear each day, she gains a +4 bonus to Strength to determine her light encumbrance. This does not affect her maximum carrying capacity. The efficient distribution of weight simply encumbers her less than the same amount of weight normally should. Finally, the Pathfinder chronicler gains a +4 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal small objects on her person.
Master Scribe							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:A Pathfinder chronicler adds her class level as a bonus on all Linguistics and Profession (scribe) checks, as well as Use Magic Device checks involving scrolls or other written magical items. A Pathfinder chronicler can make Linguistics checks to decipher text as a full-round action and can always take 10 on Linguistics and Profession (scribe) checks, even if distracted or endangered.
Live to Tell the Tale						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:At 2nd level, once per day pertwo class levels, a Pathfinder chronicler can attempt a new saving throw against any ongoing condition against which she failed a saving throw in a previous round, even if the effect is normally permanent. This ability has no effect on conditions that do not allow saving throws or against instantaneous effects.
Pathfinding								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a Pathfinder chronicler develops an excellent sense of direction and skill at leading others through difficult terrain or by following ancient maps. A Pathfinder chronicler gains a +5 bonus on Survival checks made to avoid becoming lost and to Intelligence checks to escape a maze spell. In addition, she always uses the "road or trail" overland movement modifier even when in trackless terrain, whether on foot or mounted. With a DC 15 Survival check, the Pathfinder chronicler can extend this benefit to one companion per class level.
Improved Aid							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:Pathfinder chroniclers frequentlyserve as the companions of great heroes, standing by their sides and recording their deeds, but often lending a crucial helping hand. Starting at 3rd level, a Pathfinder chronicler  using the aid another action grants a +4 bonus, rather than the normal +2.
Epic Tales								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:A 4th-level Pathfinder chronicler can inscribe a tale so evocative and so moving that it conveys  the effects of bardic music through the written word. Tocreate an epic tale requires two daily uses of her bardic music ability, and any relevant skill ranks or checks are made with Profession (scribe) rather than Perform (oratory). An epic tale affects only the reader, but it grants all the benefits that would normally apply for hearing a performance. A Pathfinder chronicler may apply the effects of any feats that affect bardic music to her epic tales. An epic tale retains its supernatural potency for 1 day per class level. It requires 1 hour to inscribe, a full-round action to activate, and has a duration of 1 minute. Once activated, an epic tale's magic is consumed.
Whispering Campaign						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:Pathfinder chroniclers influence the world through their control of information and ability to shape public perception. At 5th level, as a special use of bardic music, the Pathfinder chronicler can create the effect of a doom spell as cast by a sorcerer of her class level by denouncing a creature in person. This is a language-dependent effect. Alternatively, the chronicler can denounce a particular target (an individual or a definable group of creatures) to others. This form of bardic music creates the effect of the enthrall spell, but at the end of the performance all creatures who failed to save shift their attitude toward the target of the oration by one step (in the direction of the Pathfinder chronicler's choice) for 1 day per class level.
Inspire Action		KEY:Inspire Action ~ PFC	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DEFINE:InspireActionBonus|0	DESC:As a special use of bardic music, a 6th level Pathfinder chronicler can exhort any one ally within hearing to a sudden surge of action, allowing her ally to immediately take an extra move action. This does not count against the ally's number of actions on his own turn.|PREVAREQ:InspireActionBonus,0	DESC:As a special use of bardic music, a 6th level Pathfinder chronicler can exhort any one ally within hearing to a sudden surge of action, allowing her ally to immediately take an extra standard action. This does not count against the ally's number of actions on his own turn.|PREVARGTEQ:InspireActionBonus,1
Call Down the Legends						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:At 7th level, once per week as a full-round action, a Pathfinder chronicler can summon 2d4 4th-level human barbarians, as if she used a bronze horn of Valhalla; these summoned barbarians serve her with complete loyalty. The barbarians are constructs, not actual people (although they seem to be). They arrive with the normal starting equipment for barbarians (see page 454) and attack anyone the chronicler designates.
Greater Epic Tales						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:At 8th level, the Pathfinder chronicler's written word gains power. This ability functions like the chronicler's epic tales ability, except that if read aloud, the bardic music takes effect as if the author had used the ability, but the effects are targeted by the reader and use the reader's Charisma score where applicable.
Lay of the Exalted Dead						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:Once per week as a full round action, a 10th-level Pathfinder chronicler can summon 1d4+1 5th-level human barbarians, as if she used an iron horn of Valhalla. The summoned barbarians serve her with complete and unquestioning loyalty. They are constructs, with the incorporeal subtype (they take 50%% of the damage from corporeal sources, and no damage from nonmagical sources). They arrive wearing +2 studded leather and wielding +1 ghost touch greataxes (allowing them to deal full damage to corporeal creatures) and attack anyone the chronicler designates. To the chronicler and their allies, these exalted dead appear like a noble troop of spectral warriors. Her enemies, however, behold the terrible wrath of the ancient heroes and must succeed at Will saves or become shaken for 1 round per summoned barbarian (DC 15 + the Pathfinder chronicler's Charisma modifier).

Unlike a normal shadow, this shadow's alignment matches that of the shadowdancer, and the creature cannot create spawn. The summoned shadow receives a +4 bonus on Will saves made to halve the damage from positive channeled energy and the shadow cannot be turned or commanded. This shadow serves as a companion to the shadowdancer and can communicate intelligibly with the shadowdancer. This shadow has a number of hit points equal to half the shadowdancer's total. The shadow uses the shadowdancer's base attack bonus and base save bonuses. Otherwise, this shadow is identical to the shadow found in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary. If a shadow companion is destroyed, or the shadowdancer chooses to dismiss it, the shadowdancer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save. If the saving throw fails, the shadowdancer gains one permanent negative level. A successful saving throw avoids this negative level. A destroyed or dismissed shadow companion cannot be replaced for 30 days.																						SOURCEPAGE:p.

A shadowdancer can jump up to a total of 40 feet each day in this way; this may be a single jump of 40 feet or four jumps of 10 feet each. Every two levels higher than 4th, the distance a shadowdancer can jump each day doubles (80 feet at 6th, 160 feet at 8th, and 320 feet at 10th).
