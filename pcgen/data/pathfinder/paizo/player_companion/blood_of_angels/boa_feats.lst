Archon Diversion		TYPE:Combat			DESC:You are able to throw yourself in front of danger to protect your friends.												BENEFIT:You are able to throw yourself in front of danger to protect your friends. The penalty to AC for using Archon Style to grant nearby allies a bonus to AC against a single opponent decreases to -1, and you can spend a move action instead of a standard action to use this ability.  Once per round while using Archon Style, when you have at least one hand free, you can divert one melee weapon attack that would have struck an adjacent ally and take the blow in your ally's stead, using your own AC to determine whether the attack hits you. Whether or not a diverted attack actually hits you, the ally you protected can make an attack of opportunity against the diverted opponent. You expend no action to divert the attack, but you must be aware of it and must not be flat-footed.  You must declare that you are using this feat after your opponent has declared the target of its melee attack but before it makes its attack roll.		PREMULT:2,[PREFEAT:3,Archon Style,Combat Expertise,Improved Unarmed Strike],[PREMULT:1,[PREATT:4],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=4]]
Archon Justice		TYPE:Combat			DESC:Your righteous indignation knows no bounds, and foes that attack your companions soon learn the error of their foolish ways.				BENEFIT:Your righteous indignation knows no bounds, and foes that attack your companions soon learn the error of their foolish ways. You no longer take a penalty to AC for using Archon Style to grant nearby allies a bonus to AC against a single opponent, and you can spend a swift action instead of a move action to use this ability.  Whenever you take damage from using Archon Diversion to divert an opponent's attack toward yourself, any allies threatening your opponent can make an attack of opportunity against the diverted opponent.

Archon Style		TYPE:Combat.Style		DESC:You have trained thoroughly to protect your allies from harm, even if it means temporarily sacrificing your own safety in the process.		BENEFIT:You have trained thoroughly to protect your allies from harm, even if it means temporarily sacrificing your own safety in the process. While using this style, as a standard action, you can actively protect adjacent allies from a single opponent that you are currently adjacent to. This grants any adjacent allies a +2 dodge bonus to AC against that opponent's next melee attack (as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next turn), but causes you to take a -2 penalty to AC against that opponent until your next turn. The dodge bonus persists even if your allies move away from you, but still only applies against attacks made by the opponent that you designated upon first using this ability.																																						PREMULT:2,[PREFEAT:2,Combat Expertise,Improved Unarmed Strike],[PREMULT:1,[PREATT:2],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=2]]

You must have dismissal or banishment prepared or otherwise available to cast, and using this ability casts the corresponding spell.

BENEFIT:You infuse spells with heavenly power, drastically increasing their effectiveness against would-be heralds of evil. A consecrated spell is treated as a maximized spell against evil creatures and creatures with the evil subtype. Against all other creatures, this feat does not modify the spell in any way (for example, a consecrated fireball acts as a normal fireball against neutral or good creatures).
