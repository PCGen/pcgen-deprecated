(This slow petrification does not alter a bitten creature's natural armor.) A creature that is reduced to 0 Dexterity by a cockatrice's bites immediately turns completely to stone, as if petrified by a flesh to stone spell. Every day, a creature petrified by a cockatrice in this manner can attempt a new DC 12 Fortitude save to recover from the petrification, at which point the victim returns to flesh with 1 Dexterity (and thereafter can be restored to full Dexterity by natural healing or magic as normal)--but after a petrified creature fails three of these Fortitude saves in a row, the petrified state becomes permanent. A creature restored to flesh via magic has its Dexterity damage caused by cockatrice bites removed, but not any existing Dexterity damage from other sources. A cockatrice is immune to the petrification ability of itself and of other cockatrices, but other petrification attacks affect them normally.

SOURCEPAGE:p.80								BENEFIT:Three times per day, a pit fiend can spend a minute to transform nearby lemures into other lesser devils. A pit fiend can transform one lemure for every Hit Die the pit fiend possesses. It can then reshape these lemures into a number of Hit Dice's worth of lesser devils (see page 71) equal to the number of lemures affected. Lemures to be reshaped must be within 50 feet of the pit fiend, becoming stationary and unable to move once the shaping begins. After a minute passes, the lemures reform into the shape of a new lesser devil ready to follow the orders of the pit fiend. Although pit fiends can, technically, elevate a mass of 20 lemures into a new pit fiend, most are hesitant to do so since they have no special control over a devil created in this manner.

A DC %1 Fortitude save reduces this damage to 3d6+18. The soul of a creature slain by this attack becomes trapped within the devourer's chest. The creature cannot be brought back to life until the devourer's destruction releases its soul. A devourer can hold only one soul at a time. The trapped essence provides a devourer with 5 essence points for each Hit Die possessed by the soul. A devourer must expend essence points when it uses a spell-like ability equal to the spell's level. At the start of an encounter, a devourer generally has 3d4+3 essence points available. The trapped essence gains one permanent negative level for every 5 points of essence drained--these negative levels remain if the creature is brought back to life (but they do not stack with any negative levels imparted by being brought back to life).

While none of these effects harms the soul, the caster makes a DC 25 caster level check when a spell is deflected--success indicates that the trapped soul is released from its prison and the creature whose body it belonged to can now be restored to life as normal.

The vortex form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if it enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the vortex if it touches or enters the vortex, or if the vortex moves into or through a creature's space. In vortex form the elemental cannot make its normal attacks, and does not threaten the area around it. Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the vortex might take damage when caught in the vortex (generally damage equal the elementals slam attack). An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save (DC %2) when it comes into contact with the vortex or take damage as if it were hit by the elemental's slam attack. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the vortex, automatically taking the indicated damage each round. Creatures trapped in the vortex cannot move except to go where the vortex carries them or to escape the vortex. Trapped creatures can otherwise act normally, but must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the vortex take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. The vortex can have only as many creatures trapped inside at one time as will fit inside the vortex's volume. The vortex can eject any carried creatures whenever you wish as a free action, depositing them in the elementas's space. If the vortex's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the creature and has a diameter equal to half the Vortex's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud of debris must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.|VortexHeight|VortexDC

If it succeeds, it engulfs the prey and inflicts 1d8+7 points of damage and 2d6 acid damage as the cavity floods with digestive enzymes.	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	BENEFIT:If a giant flytrap begins its turn with an opponent at least two size categories smaller than itself grappled in one of its mouths, it can close its jaws completely around the foe by making a new combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the foe). If it succeeds, it engulfs the prey and inflicts 1d8+7 points of damage and 2d6 acid damage as the cavity floods with digestive enzymes. The seal formed is airtight, so an engulfed creature risks suffocation. Engulf is a special form of pinning, and an engulfed creature can escape in the same way as he can from being pinned, but since an engulfed creature is contained wholly inside the plant's jaws, the flytrap's victim cannot be targeted by effects or attacks that require line of sight or line of effect.

To sever a head, an opponent must make a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting a head. A head is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and hit points equal to the hydra's HD. To sever a head, an opponent must inflict enough damage to reduce the head's hit points to 0 or less. Severing a head deals damage to the hydra's body equal to the hydra's current HD.

SOURCEPAGE:p.180	BENEFIT:As a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, an intellect devourer can reduce its size, crawl into the mouth of a helpless or dead creature, and burrow into the victim's skull to devour its brain. This is a coup de grace attempt that inflicts 8d4+3d6+8 points of damage. If the victim is slain (or already dead), the intellect devourer usurps control of the body and may use it as its own, as if it controlled the target via a dominate monster spell. The intellect devourer has full access to all of the host's defensive and offensive abilities save for spellcasting and spell-like abilities (although the intellect devourer can still use its own spell-like abilities). A host body may not have been dead for longer than 1 day for this ability to function, and even successfully inhabited bodies decay to uselessness in 7 days (unless this time is extended via gentle repose). As long as the intellect devourer occupies the body, it knows (and can speak) the languages known by the victim and basic information about the victim's identity and personality, yet has none of the victim's specific memories or knowledge. Damage done to a host body does not harm the intellect devourer, and if the host body is slain, the intellect devourer emerges and is dazed for 1 round. Raise dead cannot restore a victim of body theft, but resurrection or more powerful magic can.

SOURCEPAGE:p.215	BENEFIT:All night hags carry a heartstone, a special gemstone worth at least 1,800 gp that is worn as a periapt. A heartstone's magic is fueled by the hag's spirit and proximity; once separated from its owner (or upon the hag's death), a heartstone retains its magic for only 24 hours before becoming a nonmagical gem again. The heartstone instantly cures any disease contracted by the holder. In addition, a heartstone provides a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws (this bonus is included in the statistics block above). A night hag that loses this charm can no longer use etherealness or soul bind until it finds a replacement gemstone.
## The heartston needs to be converted to a magic item to go along with this Supernatural ability. The spell-like abilities of etherealness and soul bind as well as the Fort/Ref/Will bonuses need to be moved to the heartstone item.

Rejuvenation	KEY:Rejuvenation ~ Lich		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural										DESC:When a lich is destroyed, its phylactery immediately begins to rebuild the undead spellcaster's body nearby.																SOURCEPAGE:p.189										BENEFIT:When a lich is destroyed, its phylactery (which is generally hidden by the lich in a safe place far from where it chooses to dwell) immediately begins to rebuild the undead spellcaster's body nearby. This process takes 1d10 days--if the body is destroyed before that time passes, the phylactery merely starts the process anew. After this time passes, the lich wakens fully healed (albeit without any gear it left behind on its old body), usually with a burning need for revenge against those who previously destroyed it.
Fear Aura		KEY:Fear Aura ~ Lich		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Aura	DEFINE:LichFearAuraDC|10+(TL/2)+CHA			DESC:Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60- foot radius that look at the lich must succeed on a Will save or become frightened.

Creatures with 5 HD or more must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for a number of rounds equal to the lich's Hit Dice. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same lich's aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

Remove paralysis or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the bestow curse spell description, DC %1). The effect cannot be dispelled.

###Block: Vampire Abilities
# Ability Name		Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type									Description																																																																																																			Source Page		Aspects									Description of the Benefits
Blood Drain			KEY:Blood Drain ~ Vampire		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural				DESC:A vampire can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the vampire establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage.																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.271											BENEFIT:A vampire can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the vampire establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. The vampire heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood.
Children of the Night	KEY:Children of the Night ~ Vampire	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural				DESC:Once per day, a vampire can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or 2d6 wolves as a standard action.																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.271											BENEFIT:Once per day, a vampire can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or 2d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might summon other creatures of similar power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.
Create Spawn		KEY:Create Spawn ~ Vampire		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural				DESC:A vampire can create spawn out of those it slays with blood drain or energy drain, provided that the slain creature is of the same creature type as the vampire's base creature type.																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.271											BENEFIT:A vampire can create spawn out of those it slays with blood drain or energy drain, provided that the slain creature is of the same creature type as the vampire's base creature type. The victim rises from death as a vampire in 1d4 days. This vampire is under the command of the vampire that created it, and remains enslaved until its master's destruction. A vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead. A vampire may free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again.
Dominate			KEY:Dominate ~ Vampire			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural				DESC:A vampire can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action.																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.271											BENEFIT:A vampire can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under the vampire's influence, as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet. At the GM's discretion, some vampires might be able to affect different creature types with this power.
Energy Drain		KEY:Energy Drain ~ Vampire		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural				DESC:A creature hit by a vampire's slam (or other natural weapon) gains two negative levels.																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.271											BENEFIT:A creature hit by a vampire's slam (or other natural weapon) gains two negative levels.

Vampire Weaknesses							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Weakness					DESC:Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. Vampires cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. Reducing a vampire's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure. Immersion in running water inflicts damage on a vampire equal to 1/3 of its maximum hit points. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless vampire's heart instantly slays it.	SOURCEPAGE:p.270											BENEFIT:Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don't harm the vampire--they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a vampire can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 25 Will save. Vampires cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. Reducing a vampire's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in running water inflicts damage on a vampire equal to onethird of its maximum hit points--a vampire reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless vampire's heart instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the head is also severed and anointed with holy water.
