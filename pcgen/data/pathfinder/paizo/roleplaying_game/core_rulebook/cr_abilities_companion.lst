Link									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:A master can handle her animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.52								BENEFIT:A master can handle her animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if she doesn't have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill.

Share Spells							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:The master may cast a spell with a target of "You" on her animal companion instead of on herself.															SOURCEPAGE:p.52								BENEFIT:The master may cast a spell with a target of "You" on her animal companion (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on herself. A master may cast spells on her animal companion even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion's type (animal). Spells cast in this way must come from a class that grants an animal companion. This ability does not allow the animal to share abilities that are not spells, even if they function like spells.

If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the "toucher."

SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:The master has an empathic link with his familiar to a 1 mile distance. The master can communicate emphatically with the familiar, but cannot see through its eyes.

Spell Resistance				KEY:Spell Resistance ~ Familiar	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:A familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5.									SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5.

The vortex is always 5 feet wide at its base. A vortex's width at its peak is always equal to half of its height. The elemental controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet and at most %1 feet high. The vortex form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if it enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the vortex if it touches or enters the vortex, or if the vortex moves into or through a creature's space. In vortex form the elemental cannot make its normal attacks, and does not threaten the area around it. Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the vortex might take damage when caught in the vortex (generally damage equal the elementals slam attack). An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save (DC %2) when it comes into contact with the vortex or take damage as if it were hit by the elemental's slam attack. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the vortex, automatically taking the indicated damage each round. Creatures trapped in the vortex cannot move except to go where the vortex carries them or to escape the vortex. Trapped creatures can otherwise act normally, but must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the vortex take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. The vortex can have only as many creatures trapped inside at one time as will fit inside the vortex's volume. The vortex can eject any carried creatures whenever you wish as a free action, depositing them in the elemental's space. If the vortex's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the creature and has a diameter equal to half the Vortex's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud of debris must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.|VortexHeight|VortexDC
