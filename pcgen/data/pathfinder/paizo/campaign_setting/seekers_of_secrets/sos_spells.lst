###Block: Spells
# Spell Name	Classes of caster					School			Type				Components												Casting Time			Range					Target Area or Effect							Duration									Save Info						Spell Resistance				Source Page		Description
Book Ward		CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Abjuration		TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M/DF (A drop of clear oil)							CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:One touched object of up to 10 pounds/level	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days or until discharged (see text)	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:As protection from energy, except as noted above and that the spell only protects against acid and fire damage. While the energy protection remains, the item is also completely waterproof (this protection extends to other liquids as well, such as alcohol and oil).
Questing Stone	CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=4		SCHOOL:Divination		TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S, F											CASTTIME:10 minutes		RANGE:Touch and unlimited	TARGETAREA:One ioun stone touched					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes (D)					SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:This spell functions like arcane eye, except that it uses an ioun stone as a visible scrying sensor. The ioun stone moves at the same rate as an arcane eye, and may pass through holes or spaces  as small as 2 inches in diameter. It can enter another plane of existence using a gate or similar portal, but the caster loses contact with the sensor should this occur. The enhanced ioun stone has AC 24, 10 hp, hardness 5, fly speed 30 (perfect), and a +16 Stealth bonus. The stone does not provide you with its normal benefits while you are using it as a scrying sensor.
Revelation		CLASSES:Bard=2|Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=3	SCHOOL:Divination		TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S												CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds; see text																	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:You gain a brief understanding of the workings of a single puzzle, device, or trap, gaining an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +10) on checks to disable, manipulate or solve the object in question. Your insight is ineffable; you are unable to communicate your understanding to others. At the GM's option, this spell may instead give you a clue or other piece of useful information. In this case you may communicate the clue to others and retain knowledge of it after the spell's duration has expired.
Scrivener's Chant	CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=0	SCHOOL:Transmutation	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M (fine sand and a vial of ink)						CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:5 ft.				TARGETAREA:One or more written objects				DURATION:Concentration, up to (CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will (harmless, object)		SPELLRES:Yes (object)			SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:This spell imbues a quill with animate energy and rapidly transcribes words from one page to another. The quill copies a written work at the rate of one normal-sized page per minute. The Linguistics skill can be used to make a convincing copy, but otherwise the reproduction is written in the hand of the caster. You must concentrate upon the material being duplicated for the spell's duration and provide new blank pages as required. The scrivener's chant requires blank paper and a quill or other writing materials, in addition to the material components. This spell cannot duplicate magical writing (including spells and magical scrolls), though it can duplicate non-magical writing from a magical source.
Teleport Trap	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7			SCHOOL:Abjuration		TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S, M (powdered lodestone and silver worth 100 gp per 40-ft. cube)	CASTTIME:10 minutes		RANGE:Medium			TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) 40-ft. cubes (S)				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days						SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.18	DESC:Teleport trap wards an area, redirecting all teleportation into or out of the area to a specific point within the area determined by you at the time of casting. The destination must be an open space, though it does not need to have a solid surface for the target to stand upon. The spell's area overlaps walls and other solid and liquid objects (preventing intruders from bypassing the ward by teleporting into a wall or similar means).
