When dealing damage with a weapon to which you add your Dexterity to your attack rolls, you can reroll any result of 1 on your weapon's damage dice (you must keep the result of the reroll).

SOURCEPAGE:p.58											BENEFIT:You may decide to make a ranged attack defensively, taking a -2 penalty to all ranged attacks you make during the round.

SOURCEPAGE:p.60											BENEFIT:You can attempt to gain an advantage by feinting with a primary weapon, then attacking with a secondary. When you are wielding two weapons, as a standard action you may make a single attack with a light weapon in your off-hand. Rather than a standard attack roll, make a Bluff check. If your check exceeds your target's AC, your attack hits for your usual off-hand damage. If your check also exceeds a DC of 10 + the target's base attack bonus + the target's Wisdom modifier (or 10 + the target's Sense Motive bonus, whichever is higher), your target is also denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against this attack.
Falter																TYPE:Combat.AttackOption																						PREFEAT:1,Catch Off-Guard																																																																															DESC:Look off-balance to lure in a target.																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.61											BENEFIT:As a standard action, you may make a Bluff check to appear to have made a misstep and be off-balance. This is opposed by the Sense Motive check of any opponent observing you. If you win this check, the opponent believes you have lost your Dexterity bonus to your AC. Not only is this not the case, any foe fooled by this Bluff that attacks you in the next round and misses also provokes an attack of opportunity from you.
Footwork																TYPE:Combat																									PREFEAT:2,Dodge,Nimble Moves																																																			PRESKILL:1,Acrobatics=5																									DESC:Gain a +1 dodge bonus when able to move freely.

SOURCEPAGE:p.62											BENEFIT:Whenever you need to make an initiative check to determine initiative order, you automatically get a result of %1.

SOURCEPAGE:p.62											BENEFIT:You can form an ambush plan for any combat area you have information about in advance. You must either observe the conditions of the prospective battlefield personally, or receive a detailed scouting report. Forming a plan takes 1 minute, but if the information you base it on is inaccurate (or changes) your plan grants no bonus. Your plan grants a bonus to you and any allies you have briefed on the plan based on your Stealth check: +1 if 20 or less; +2 if 21-30; or +3 if 31 or more. This bonus begins in the 1st round of combat, and is reduced by 1 at the end of your turn on the 2nd round of combat, and each round thereafter. The bonus applies to attack rolls, saving throws, and Stealth checks.
Head Butt																TYPE:Combat																									PREFEAT:1,Toughness																																																													PRESTAT:1,CON=13																	DESC:Gain a natural weapon attack.											TEMPLATE:CHOOSE:Head Butt ~ Small|Head Butt ~ Medium|Head Butt ~ Large																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.62											BENEFIT:You gain a head butt natural attack. If you have an unarmed attack that deals more damage, you may choose to deal that damage instead. If you damage a foe with this natural weapon, you take 1/4 of the damage you inflict (damage reduction does not modify this damage). You can use this natural attack without penalty even if your hands and feet are bound, or if you are in a grapple.
Improved Catch Off-Guard													TYPE:Combat																									PREFEAT:1,Catch Off-Guard																																																																															DESC:Constantly surprise foes with improvised weapons.																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.63											BENEFIT:Foes (even armed foes) are flat-footed against attacks you make with an improvised weapon. At the end of each round as a free action, a foe may make a Sense Motive check opposed by your Bluff check. If the foe is successful, it stops being flat-footed by any improvised weapon attack you make for 24 hours. Your improvised weapon attacks threaten a critical on an attack roll of 19-20.
Knife Trick																TYPE:Combat																																																																																																												DESC:Draw and attack with a light weapon using Sleight of Hand.																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.63											BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can draw a light weapon and attack one target with it. Rather than make a standard attack roll, make a Sleight of Hand check. If your skill check exceeds your target's AC, your attack hits. If your skill check also exceeds a DC of 10 + the target's base attack bonus + the target's Wisdom modifier (or 10 + the target's Sense Motive bonus, whichever is higher), your target is also denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against this attack. Any given target may be the target of your knife trick only once per day.
# I guess the user will have to implement bonuses as an EQMOD as the UI won't let you equip two armors; hence there is no way of knowing which armors are being combined.

If you have limited spells known, you do not automatically know these spells, but you may learn three of them for only one spell slot towards your maximum spells known. Each time you kill a living creature with a CR of at least %1, you gain one death mark. You may spend a death mark to cast one of your known selected spells by spending a spell slot of the same level or higher. Each day when you regain uses of your spells, you lose any unused death marks.|TL-3
Plait Incantation								TYPE:General.Magister		PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=1				PREFEAT:1,Spell Focus																																												DESC:Ready to use a spell to increase another caster's spell power.																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.66	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can ready an action to plait one of your spells into that of another spellcaster. When the allied spellcaster casts a spell, you take your readied action to cast your spell in response. Rather than have its normal effect, your spell grants your allied spellcaster a +2 enhancement bonus to his caster level for the spell that triggered your readied action. The spell you use to plait with your ally's must be within 2 levels of the spell cast by your ally, and cannot be a 0-level spell.
Scorch Hex									TYPE:General																																			PRESPELLDESCRIPTOR:3,Fire=0																			DESC:Reduce a fire spell's save DC to gain a secondary effect.																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.67	BENEFIT:You can cast spells that deal fire damage and allow a saving throw as scorch spells, setting any target that fails its save on fire. The save DC of the scorch spell is 1 lower than normal. The fire burns until extinguished (as a standard action or by an ally making a DC 15+spell level Heal check). Burning targets take fire damage at the beginning of your turn every round depending on the level of the scorch spell (0-1st level: 1 point; 2nd-3rd level: 1d3 points; 4th-5th: 1d4 points; 6th+: 1d6 points). Targets with Improved Evasion and those immune to fire damage (or non-flammable) are immune to this added effect.
Secret Spell								TYPE:General																									PRESKILL:2,Bluff=5,Spellcraft=5																												DESC:Cast a spell stealthily.																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.68	BENEFIT:You may make a Spellcraft check to conceal the act of spellcasting from opponents observing you (+5 if the spell has no verbal component; -5 if the spell has a material component or focus). Your check is opposed each round of casting by the Perception check of each observer. Casting a spell secretly takes at least a full round action, even if the spell's normal casting time is less. If the spell has no listed visual or other sensory effects, any opponent who fails the opposed Perception check is unaware a spell has been cast; otherwise, observers become aware you have cast the spell once it takes effect, even if they failed their Perception check.
Sidewinder Hex								TYPE:General																									PRESKILL:1,Bluff=3																														DESC:Cast a spell that fakes what target it's headed for.																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.69	BENEFIT:You can cast spells that deal damage as sidewinder spells, which give false visual cues as to their end destination. Such spells must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less, target one or more creatures (rather than an area), and either deal dice of damage or have a duration based on caster level. Casting the spell as a sidewinder hex takes a full-round action, and allows you to make a Bluff check opposed by the Sense Motive check of each target. Targets that fail the opposed check suffer a -2 penalty to their AC and saving throws against the sidewinder hex. However, the spell deals 1 point less damage per die (if it deals dice of damage) and has its duration halved (if it has a duration based on caster level).
#TODO: Enforce Spell Mastery/Domain spell selection (requires more support from the SPELLS tag than presently available, or else a whole bucket of ABILITYPOOL work)

MULT:YES	CHOOSE:SPELLS|ALL[KNOWN=YES]																										SOURCEPAGE:p.69	BENEFIT:You can channel stored spell energy into your signature spell even if you haven't prepared it ahead of time. (A signature spell must be one you have Spell Mastery with, or be from one of your domains.) You can cast your signature spell spontaneously by losing a prepared spell of the same level or higher.
Spell Bluff			KEY:Spell Bluff ~ SGGAH			TYPE:General											PREFEAT:1,Secret Spell											PRESKILL:2,Bluff=5,Spellcraft=5																												DESC:Fool observers about what spell you are casting.																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.70	BENEFIT:You may make a Bluff check when spellcasting to fool observers into thinking you are casting a different spell (-5 if the spell has a material component or focus). Your check is opposed each round of casting by the Spellcraft check of each observer. You select what spell those failing their Spellcraft check believe you are casting (if this is not a spell you can cast you take a -5 penalty to your Bluff check). The effects of your spell may reveal your deception once it has been fully cast, but not until after it is too late for a foe to counterspell.

SOURCEPAGE:p.70	BENEFIT:While casting a spell from a school of magic in which you have Spell Focus, you can cause a bewildering show of lights and sounds to accompany the spellcasting. Casting a spell in this way takes at least a full round, even if the casting time of the spell is normally less than this. Make a Spellcraft check to demoralize all foes within 30 ft. who can see your display (this works in the same way as the Intimidate skill).

Any time you fail a Bluff, Disguise, or Linguistics (Forgery) check, you lose one duplicity mark. You may spend a duplicity mark to cast one of your known selected spells by spending a spell slot of the same level or higher. Each day when you regain uses of your spells, you lose any unused duplicity marks.

TYPE:General																	PREFEAT:1,Deceitful						PRESKILL:2,Bluff=1,Intimidate=1																							DESC:Toss an object to a foe, in hopes he'll catch it and drop his weapons.																														SOURCEPAGE:p.57								BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can toss a small, non-weapon item at a target within 20 ft. while firmly shouting for them to catch it. You may make a Bluff check against the target's CMD. If your check succeeds, the target reflexively catches the item, dropping any held item to do so. The following conditions impose a cumulative -5 penalty to your Bluff check for each that applies: the target is threatened or in danger from you or your allies; you are not speaking a language understood by the target; or the target has more levels or hit dice than you. This feat does not work on any target that has seen this trick being used within the past 24 hours.

This requires you to develop some story by which you admit your first bluff was a lie, but explain it away as part of a new lie. This second attempt is at only a -2 penalty, instead of the normal -10 penalty for a second effort to deceive. If your second attempt fails, no third attempt is possible, regardless of what strategem you employ.

Entering this trance-like state is a standard action, and while maintaining it you are paralyzed. In this trance you can hold your breath for %1 minutes, which is also the maximum duration of your trance. You appear dead to all casual observers and may make a Bluff check (opposed by an examiner's Heal or Perception check, whichever is higher) to appear dead even to careful examination. If you ready an action to use this feat when you are next struck for damage, the attacker must make a Perception check opposed by your Bluff, or believe it has slain you.|CONSCORE

Muffle											TYPE:General																	PREFEAT:2,Improved Grapple,Improved Unarmed Strike							PRESTAT:1,DEX=13																				DESC:Silence the targets of your grapples.																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.65								BENEFIT:When you successfully initiate a grapple, you muffle sounds made by your target until it breaks the grapple. While the target is free to cry out (or fulfil the verbal components of spellcasting), you suppress the sounds so it is difficult for even nearby creatures to hear those noises. You may make a Stealth check against any opponent not directly observing you to prevent the sounds and movement of the grapple from being noticed.
Patois											TYPE:General																										PRESKILL:1,Linguistics=5		PRESTAT:1,INT=13																				DESC:Communicate in languages you don't know.																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.66								BENEFIT:Whenever you encounter creatures speaking a language you don't know, you can attempt to communicate by using phrases and words from similar languages. This requires you to make a Linguistics check (DC 15) for each concept you try to convey or understand, and even then only simple concepts can be exchanged. (As a general rule, each check allows you to send and receive one idea that can be expressed with no more than 5 single-syllable words.)

SOURCEPAGE:p.68								BENEFIT:You may make a Spellcraft check in place of a Perception check to notice spells, spell effects, magic items, and creatures of the aberration, construct, dragon, fey, outsider, and undead types. If you beat the required DC to notice something with Spellcraft by 5, you learn what category of thing you have sensed (including its type if it is a creature).
Subtle											TYPE:General																																																						DESC:Your actions are difficult to notice.																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.70								BENEFIT:When you make certain skill checks (Appraise and Escape Artist checks, Diplomacy checks to gather information, or Perception checks to notice fine details), subjects observing or interacting with you must make Sense Motive checks (opposed by whatever skill you are using) to realize you are doing anything other than engaging in casual conversation or observation.
Thieves' Cant										TYPE:General													PRECSKILL:1,Bluff																																							DESC:Send and receive secret messages.																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.71								BENEFIT:Your subtle cunning improves your use of the Bluff skill to pass secret messages. You may attempt to pass a secret message of no more than 15 words as a free action once per round (rather than a full-round action) and characters other than the intended recipient take a -5 penalty to Sense Motive checks to intercept your message. Any time you attempt to send a secret message to an ally who has the Thieves' Cant feat, there is no chance of the message being misunderstood.
Wall Runner											TYPE:General																	PREFEAT:2,Acrobatic Steps,Nimble Moves									PRESTAT:1,WIS=13																				DESC:Run up along walls.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.72								BENEFIT:As long as you are no more than lightly encumbered and suffering an armor check penalty of no more than -1, you can take part of one move action each round to traverse a wall or other relatively smooth vertical surface if you begin and end your move on a horizontal surface. If you do not end your move on a horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking falling damage as appropriate. Treat the wall as a normal floor for the purpose of measuring your movement. Passing from floor to wall, or wall to floor, costs no movement; you can change surfaces freely. Opponents on the ground can make attacks of opportunity normally if you leave a threatened space.
