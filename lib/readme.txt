As it becomes necessary for library files to be delivered with PCGen, this is the directory where those libraries should be placed. It is our goal to make these libraries optional whenever possible.
If a jar has dependencies, please try to place it's dependencies in the same subdirectory as the jar.

Currently included are:
emma/emma.jar -- Code coverage tool. There is an ant task that runs it. http://emma.sourceforge.net/ TODO Move this into the test directory.
emma/emma_ant.jar -- Ant tasks for emma. http://emma.sourceforge.net/ TODO Move this into the test directory.
