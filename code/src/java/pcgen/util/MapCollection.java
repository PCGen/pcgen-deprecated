 * 
 * A MapCollection is a facade used to convert a Map to a Collection. This is
 * useful if one wishes to treat the contents of the Map (both the keys and the
 * values) as a single Collection. For example, this could be used to join
 * together the contents of a Map.
 * 
 * As this is a facade emulating a simple data structure (with a complex
 * underlying data structure), certain functions are ill-defined. Modification
 * of the collection is prohibited, and all methods that would normally modify a
 * Collection (such as add, remove or clear) will throw an
 * UnsupportedOperationException.
 * 
 * This class is reference-semantic. A reference to the Map provided in the
 * constructor is kept by the MapCollection. ALL changes to the underlying Map
 * are not reflected within this Collection. Beware that an Iterator provided by
 * a MapCollection is therefore sensitive to modification of the underlying Map
 * and MAY cause a ConcurrentModificationException to occur if the underlying
 * Map is modified.
 * 
 * **WARNING** MapCollection is KNOWN to NOT fail fast in the case of a
 * Concurrent Modification - such a feature is considered more advanced than
 * this Class is trying to provide (the additional cost of memory and CPU of
 * monitoring the map is considered an unreasonable burden.
