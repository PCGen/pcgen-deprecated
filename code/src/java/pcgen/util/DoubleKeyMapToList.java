/**
 * @author Thomas Parker (thpr [at] yahoo.com)
 * 
 * Represents a DoubleKeyMap of objects to Lists. List management is done
 * internally to this class (while copies are accessible, the lists are kept
 * private to this class).
 * 
 * This class is reference-semantic. In appropriate cases (such as calling the
 * addToListFor method), DoubleKeyMapToList will maintain a reference to the
 * given Object. DoubleKeyMapToList will not modify any of the Objects it is
 * passed; however, it reserves the right to return references to Objects it
 * contains to other Objects.
 * 
 * However, when any method in which DoubleKeyMapToList returns a Collection,
 * ownership of the Collection itself is transferred to the calling Object, but
 * the contents of the Collection (keys, values, etc.) are references whose
 * ownership should be respected.
 * 
 * @param <K1>
 *            The type of the primary keys in this DoubleKeyMapToList
 * @param <K2>
 *            The type of the secondary keys in this DoubleKeyMapToList
 * @param <V>
