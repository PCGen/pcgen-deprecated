/**
 * @author Thomas Parker (thpr [at] yahoo.com)
 * 
 * Represents a Map of objects to Lists. List management is done internally to
 * this class (while copies are accessible, the lists are kept private to this
 * class).
 * 
 * This class is reference-semantic. In appropriate cases (such as calling the
 * addToListFor method), AbstractMapToList will maintain a reference to the
 * given Object. AbstractMapToList will not modify any of the Objects it is
 * passed; however, it reserves the right to return references to Objects it
 * contains to other Objects.
 * 
 * However, when any method in which AbstractMapToList returns a Collection,
 * ownership of the Collection itself is transferred to the calling Object, but
 * the contents of the Collection (keys, values, etc.) are references whose
 * ownership should be respected.
 * 
 * NOTE: This is a convenience method for use in Java 1.4 and is less beneficial
 * in Java 1.5 (Typed Collections may be more appropriate)
