/**
 * @author Thomas Parker (thpr [at] yahoo.com)
 * 
 * Represents a Map of objects to Lists. List management is done internally to
 * this class (while copies are accessible, the lists are kept private to this
 * class).
 * 
 * This class is reference-semantic. In appropriate cases (such as calling the
 * addToListFor method), GenericMapToList will maintain a reference to the given
 * Object. GenericMapToList will not modify any of the Objects it is passed;
 * however, it reserves the right to return references to Objects it contains to
 * other Objects.
 * 
 * However, when any method in which GenericMapToList returns a Collection,
 * ownership of the Collection itself is transferred to the calling Object, but
 * the contents of the Collection (keys, values, etc.) are references whose
 * ownership should be respected.
 * 
 * CAUTION: This is a convenience method for use in Java 1.4 and is not
 * appropriate for use in Java 1.5 (Typed Collections are probably more
 * appropriate)
