 * Represents a TripleKeyMap of objects to Lists. List management is done
 * internally to this class (while copies are accessible, the lists are kept
 * private to this class).
 * 
 * This class is reference-semantic. In appropriate cases (such as calling the
 * addToListFor method), TripleKeyMapToInstanceList will maintain a reference to
 * the given Object. TripleKeyMapToInstanceList will not modify any of the
 * Objects it is passed; however, it reserves the right to return references to
 * Objects it contains to other Objects.
 * 
 * However, when any method in which TripleKeyMapToInstanceList returns a
 * Collection, ownership of the Collection itself is transferred to the calling
 * Object, but the contents of the Collection (keys, values, etc.) are
 * references whose ownership should be respected.
