/**
 * @author Thomas Parker (thpr [at] yahoo.com)
 * 
 * A DoubleKeyMap is a relative of java.util.Map, however, each value is stored
 * with two keys instead of one.
 * 
 * This class is reference-semantic. In appropriate cases (such as calling the
 * addToListFor method), DoubleKeyMap will maintain a reference to the given
 * Object. DoubleKeyMap will not modify any of the Objects it is passed;
 * however, it reserves the right to return references to Objects it contains to
 * other Objects.
 * 
 * However, when any method in which DoubleKeyMap returns a Collection,
 * ownership of the Collection itself is transferred to the calling Object, but
 * the contents of the Collection (keys, values, etc.) are references whose
 * ownership should be respected.
 * 
 * Note: For purposes of containing and removing an object from a List, this
 * Class performs instance tests (meaning the use of == not .equals()).
 *

 * @param <V>
