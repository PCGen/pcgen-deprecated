 * A CaseInsensitiveMap is a HashMap that has uses a CaseInsensitiveString as
 * the Key This is a facilitating wrapper around HashMap to allow easy use of
 * CaseInsensitiveString as the Key to a Map.
 * 
 * CaseInsensitiveMap gracefully handles non-String keys (defaults back to the
 * same behavior as HashMap), including the null key. Note that this allows
 * appropriate matching behavior when a CaseInsensitiveString is passed in as
 * the key to one of the methods of CaseInsensitiveMap.
 * 
 * @param <V>
