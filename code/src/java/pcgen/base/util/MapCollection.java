 * MapCollection acts as a Facade on a Map to make it act as a Collection. This
 * is useful if you wish to iterate over both the keys and values of a Map.
 * 
 * Note: MapCollection acts as a Facade - that means the underlying Map is NOT
 * copied. Changes to the underlying Map are reflected in the MapCollection.
 * This also means that changes to the underlying Map may cause an Iterator of
 * the MapCollection to fail due to a ConcurrentModificationException.
 * 
 * **WARNING** This Class is known to NOT FAIL FAST. DO NOT rely on fail fast
 * behavior of the Iterator of MapCollection to detect changes to the underlying
 * Map.
