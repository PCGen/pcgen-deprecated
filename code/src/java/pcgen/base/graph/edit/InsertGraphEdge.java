 * InsertGraphEdge is an UndoableEdit which represents the atomic insertion of
 * an Edge into a Graph.
 * 
 * 'Atomic' indicates that this UndoableEdit does not capture or reflect any
 * side-effects that took place during the insertion of the Edge into the Graph.
 * (This class does not actually perform the insertion of the Edge). In order to
 * capture the side-effects and have an UndoableEdit which reflects all of the
 * changes that took place to a Graph as a result of the insertion of an Edge,
 * see InsertEdgeCommand.
