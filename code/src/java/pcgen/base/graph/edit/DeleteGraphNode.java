 * DeleteGraphNode is an UndoableEdit which represents the atomic deletion of a
 * Node from a Graph.
 * 
 * 'Atomic' indicates that this UndoableEdit does not capture or reflect any
 * side-effects that took place during the removal of the Node from the Graph.
 * (This class does not actually perform the removal of the Node). In order to
 * capture the side-effects and have an UndoableEdit which reflects all of the
 * changes that took place to a Graph as a result of the removal of a Node, see
 * DeleteNodeCommand.
