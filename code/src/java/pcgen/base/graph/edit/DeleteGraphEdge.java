 * DeleteGraphEdge is an UndoableEdit which represents the atomic deletion of a
 * Edge from a Graph.
 * 
 * 'Atomic' indicates that this UndoableEdit does not capture or reflect any
 * side-effects that took place during the removal of the Edge from the Graph.
 * (This class does not actually perform the removal of the Edge). In order to
 * capture the side-effects and have an UndoableEdit which reflects all of the
 * changes that took place to a Graph as a result of the removal of a Edge, see
 * DeleteGraphEdgeCommand.
