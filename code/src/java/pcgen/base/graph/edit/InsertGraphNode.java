 * InsertGraphNode is an UndoableEdit which represents the atomic insertion of a
 * Node into a Graph.
 * 
 * 'Atomic' indicates that this UndoableEdit does not capture or reflect any
 * side-effects that took place during the insertion of the Node into the Graph.
 * (This class does not actually perform the insertion of the Node). In order to
 * capture the side-effects and have an UndoableEdit which reflects all of the
 * changes that took place to a Graph as a result of the insertion of a Node,
 * see InsertNodeCommand.
