 * 
 * An UnsupportedGraphOperationException is thrown when an attempt is made to
 * perform an operation on a Graph which is not possible. This could include
 * various Graph state problems, depending on the implementation of the Graph.
 * 
 * Note that (consistent with the Collections Framework) an attempt to remove an
 * object which is not present in a Graph should not regularly cause an
 * exception. Rather, the remove* method should return false. Similar rules
 * apply for when an object cannot be added to a Graph.
 * 
 * An UnsupportedGraphOperationException should be limited to circumstances
 * where the Graph truly cannot support the operation and there is not another
 * method for communicating such a state back to the user. Like other
 * exceptions, it should also only occur in situations which are preventable by
 * performing a test (consider how an Iterator can throw NoSuchElementException
 * when the next() method is called, but will only do so for code which fails to
 * properly test the hasNext() method).
