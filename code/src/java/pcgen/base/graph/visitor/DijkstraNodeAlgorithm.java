 * 
 * This is "Dijkstra's Node Algorithm" because the Algorithm is traversing the
 * Nodes. It is assumed that the Edges have a defined length. The default length

 * the calculateEdgeLength method.
 * 
 * Note that nothing prohibits a HyperEdge from having a different length
 * between each of the nodes that it connects.
