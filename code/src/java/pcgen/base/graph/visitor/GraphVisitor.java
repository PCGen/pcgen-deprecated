/**
 * @author Thomas Parker (thpr [at] yahoo.com)
 * 
 * Provides an interface for a GraphVisitor which expects a value to be returned
 * by the visited Graph Element.
 * 
 * One use of this interface is in a fashion in a Visitor pattern (using double
 * dispatch), such as: <code>
 * public T getValue(GraphVisitor da) {
 *   return visitNode(this);
 * }
 * </code>
 * The methods in this interface are intentionally given different names so that
 * conflicts are avoided. Since Node and Edge are interfaces, the use of
 * different method names is required in order to avoid any ambiguity in the use
 * of this interface (though one could argue if someone made a single object
 * both a Node and a Edge, then they get what they deserve... but like many
 * classes in this library, this is defensive in its design (and documentation).
