 * 
 * This is a derivative of Dijkstra's Algorithm.
 * 
 * For more information, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm
 * 
 * This is "Dijkstra's Edge Algorithm" because the Algorithm is traversing the
 * Edges (not the Nodes as Dijkstra's algorithm is technically defined to be).
 * It is assumed that the Nodes have a defined area. Therefore, there is a
 * length between the Edges of the Graph (and the Edges have length zero). This
 * is useful when a Graph is used to represent a map (with the Nodes as regions
 * and the Edges as borders between those regions). [Note this is a map in the
 * navigational sense not a Map in the java.util.Map sense] The default length
 * for traversing each node is 1. This length can be modified by a sub-Class by
 * overriding the calculateEdgeSeparation method.
 * 
 * Note that it is possible for the Node to have a different separation between
 * various edges to which it is connected.
