 * This calculates the minimum weight to a given node in a Graph. This is a
 * derivative of a Breadth First Traverse
 * 
 * Note: This derivative is optimized to a Graph which has low fan-in (meaning
 * each node has very vew incoming [source] edges). Therefore, is likely that
 * NodeWeightCalculation is only useful in certain Directed Graphs. If you are
 * calculating weight for a Graph with high fan-in (but low fan-out), you should
 * use a derivative of DirectedBreadthFirstTraverseAlgorithm.
 * 
 * It is assumed that the Edges have a defined weight. The default weight for
 * each edge is 1. This weight can be modified by a sub-Class by overriding the
 * calculateEdgeWeight method. Note that weights are MULTIPLIED as edges are
 * traversed.
