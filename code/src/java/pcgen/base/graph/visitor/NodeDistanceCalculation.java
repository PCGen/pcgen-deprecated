 * This calculates the minimum distance between two Nodes in a Graph. This is a
 * derivative of Dijkstra's Algorithm, see
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm
 * 
 * Note: This derivative is optimized to a Graph which has low fan-in (meaning
 * each node has very vew incoming [source] edges). Therefore, is likely that
 * NodeDistanceCalculation is only useful in certain Directed Graphs. If you are
 * calculating distance for a Graph with high fan-in (but low fan-out), you
 * should use DijkstraNodeAlgorithm or DijkstraEdgeAlgorithm.
 * 
 * It is assumed that the Edges have a defined length. The default length for
 * each edge is 1. This length can be modified by a sub-Class by overriding the
 * calculateEdgeLength method.
