/**
 * @author Thomas Parker (thpr [at] yahoo.com)
 * 
 * An InsertEdgesCommand is a Command which, when executed, will insert a
 * Collection of Edges into a Graph.
 * 
 * Note that insertion of the Edges may have side effects upon other objects in
 * the Graph (this will depend on the Graph implementation).
 * 
 * The UndoableEdit returned by the execute() method in InsertEdgesCommand will
 * track any side effects to the graph itself (Node or Edge addition or
 * removal). Thus, if the addition of one Edge causes another Edge to be
 * deleted, the returned UndoableEdit will represent both the Edge addition and
 * the Edge deletion (and the undo() and redo() methods of the UndoableEdit
 * would undo and redo both changes).
