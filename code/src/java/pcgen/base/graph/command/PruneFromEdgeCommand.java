 * 
 * A PruneFromEdgeCommand is a Command which, when executed, will delete an Edge -
 * and all Edges and Nodes only connected to the given Edge - from a
 * DirectionalGraph.
 * 
 * *WARNING* PruneFromEdgeCommand does NOT perform a mark and sweep of the
 * Graph, it ASSUMES that the given Graph is Acyclic.
 * 
 * Note that deletion of the child Nodes may have side effects upon the Edges to
 * which the Node was connected (this will depend on the Graph implementation).
 * 
 * The UndoableEdit returned by the execute() method in PruneFromEdgeCommand
 * will track any side effects to the graph itself (Node or Edge addition or
 * removal). Thus, if the deletion of one Node causes an Edge to also be
 * deleted, the returned UndoableEdit will represent both the Node removal and
 * the Edge removal (and the undo() and redo() methods of the UndoableEdit would
 * undo and redo both deletions).
