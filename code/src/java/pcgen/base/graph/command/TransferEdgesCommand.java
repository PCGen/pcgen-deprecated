/**
 * @author Thomas Parker (thpr [at] yahoo.com)
 * 
 * A TransferEdgesCommand is a Command which will disconnect all of the edges
 * from the given Node and reconnect replacement edges to the given new Node.
 * Note that the old Node is NOT removed from the Graph by TransferEdgesCommand.
 * Note also that the new Node may have other non-related edges already
 * connected to it.
 * 
 * Note that the transfer of the GraphEdges may have side effects upon other
 * GraphElements in the Graph (this will depend on the Graph implementation).
 * 
 * The UndoableEdit returned by the execute() method in TransferEdgesCommand
 * will track any side effects to the graph itself (Node or Edge addition or
 * removal). Thus, if the transfer of Edges causes an unrelated Node to also be
 * deleted, the returned UndoableEdit will represent both the GraphEdge
 * transfers and the removal of the unrelated Node (and the undo() and redo()
 * methods of the UndoableEdit would undo and redo both the transfers and the
 * deletion).
