 * illegal relative to the execution of a given command. For example, it may
 * only be possible to insert an Edge after all of the nodes to which the edge
 * is connected have already been added to the Graph. Attempt to add the edge
 * before all of the nodes are present in the graph could result in an
 * IllegalGraphStateException being thrown.
