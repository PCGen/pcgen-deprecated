/**
 * @author Thomas Parker (thpr [at] yahoo.com)
 * 
 * An InsertEdgeCommand is a Command which, when executed, will insert an Edge
 * into a Graph.
 * 
 * Note that insertion of the Edge may have side effects upon other objects in
 * the Graph (this will depend on the Graph implementation).
 * 
 * The UndoableEdit returned by the execute() method in InsertEdgeCommand will
 * track any side effects to the graph itself (Node or Edge addition or
 * removal). Thus, if the addition of one Edge causes a Node to also be added,
 * the returned UndoableEdit will represent both the Edge addition and the Node
 * addition (and the undo() and redo() methods of the UndoableEdit would undo
 * and redo both additions).
