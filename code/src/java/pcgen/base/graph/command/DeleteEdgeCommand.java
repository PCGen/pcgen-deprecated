/**

 * 
 * A DeleteEdgeCommand is a Command which, when executed, will delete a Edge
 * from a Graph.
 * 
 * Note that deletion of the Edge may have side effects upon the Nodes to which
 * the Edge was connected (this will depend on the Graph implementation).
 * 
 * The UndoableEdit returned by the execute() method in DeleteEdgeCommand will
 * track any side effects to the graph itself (Node or Edge addition or
 * removal). Thus, if the deletion of one Edge causes a Node to also be deleted,
 * the returned UndoableEdit will represent both the Edge removal and the Node
 * removal (and the undo() and redo() methods of the UndoableEdit would undo and
 * redo both deletions)
