/**
 * @author Thomas Parker (thpr [at] yahoo.com)
 * 
 * A ReplaceNodeCommand is a Command which will replace a given Node with
 * another given Node when it is executed on the given Graph.
 * 
 * All of the edges which connect to the Node to be replaced will be replaced
 * with edges connected to the given replacement Node.
 * 
 * Note that replacement of the Node may have side effects upon other objects in
 * the Graph (this will depend on the Graph implementation).
 * 
 * The UndoableEdit returned by the execute() method in ReplaceNodeCommand will
 * track any side effects to the graph itself (Node or Edge addition or
 * removal). Thus, if the replacement of one Node causes another Node to be
 * deleted, the returned UndoableEdit will represent both the Node replacement
 * and the Node deletion (and the undo() and redo() methods of the UndoableEdit
 * would undo and redo both changes).
