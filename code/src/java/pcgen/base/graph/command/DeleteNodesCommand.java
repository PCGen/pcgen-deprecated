 * 
 * A DeleteNodesCommand is a Command which, when executed, will delete a
 * Collection of Nodes from a Graph.
 * 
 * Note that deletion of a Node may have side effects upon the Edges to which
 * the Node was connected (this will depend on the Graph implementation).
 * 
 * The UndoableEdit returned by the execute() method in DeleteNodesCommand will
 * track any side effects to the graph itself (Node or Edge addition or
 * removal). Thus, if the deletion of one Node causes an Edge to also be
 * deleted, the returned UndoableEdit will represent both the Node removal and
 * the Edge removal (and the undo() and redo() methods of the UndoableEdit would
 * undo and redo both deletions).
