/**
 * @author Thomas Parker (thpr [at] yahoo.com)
 * 
 * A PruneUnconnectedToNodeCommand is a Command which, when executed, will
 * delete all Nodes and all Edges not connected (as children or otherwise as
 * descendents) to the given Node from a DirectionalGraph. The search for what
 * is kept is a *directional search* through the given DirectionalGraph.
 * 
 * *WARNING* Executing PruneUnconnectedToNodeCommand on an object other than the
 * root object of a DirectionalGraph may delete large portions of the Graph. Be
 * aware that this only maintains the directionally connected subgraph of the
 * given Node.
 * 
 * Note that deletion of the Node may have side effects upon the Edges to which
 * the Node was connected (this will depend on the Graph implementation).
 * 
 * The UndoableEdit returned by the execute() method in
 * PruneUnconnectedToNodeCommand will track any side effects to the graph itself
 * (Node or Edge addition or removal). Thus, if the deletion of one Node causes
 * an Edge to also be deleted, the returned UndoableEdit will represent both the
 * Node removal and the Edge removal (and the undo() and redo() methods of the
 * UndoableEdit would undo and redo both deletions).
