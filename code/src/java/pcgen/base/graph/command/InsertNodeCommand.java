/**

 * 
 * An InsertNodeCommand is a Command which, when executed, will insert a Node
 * into a Graph.
 * 
 * Note that insertion of the Node may have side effects upon other objects in
 * the Graph (this will depend on the Graph implementation).
 * 
 * The UndoableEdit returned by the execute() method in InsertNodeCommand will
 * track any side effects to the graph itself (Node or Edge addition or
 * removal). Thus, if the addition of one Node causes another Node to be
 * deleted, the returned UndoableEdit will represent both the Node addition and
 * the Node deletion (and the undo() and redo() methods of the UndoableEdit
 * would undo and redo both changes).
