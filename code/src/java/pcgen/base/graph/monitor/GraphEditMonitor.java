/**
 * @author Thomas Parker (thpr [at] yahoo.com)
 * 
 * A GraphEditMonitor is a GraphChangeListener that keeps track of changes to a
 * Graph. This includes objects which are added to and objects which are removed
 * from the Graph. If an object is added to a graph and subsequently removed
 * from the Graph, then it is also deleted from the sets maintained by the
 * GraphEditMonitor. A GraphEditMonitor also tracks the removal of objects which
 * were added to the graph before the GraphEditMonitor was added as a
 * GraphChangeListener to the Graph.
 * 
 * A GraphEditMonitor is especially useful for tracking side-effects to atomic
 * changes to a Graph. For example, a GraphEditMonitor can be added as a
 * GraphChangeListener to a Graph and then a Node can be deleted from the Graph.
 * All of the changes, which may include the removal of other Nodes or Edges,
 * will be captured by the GraphEditMonitor. Then a compound UndoableEdit which
 * reflects all of the changes to the Graph can be created by the
 * GraphEditMonitor. This drastically simplifies tracking changes to a Graph
 * (which is required in order to have UndoableEdit objects available).
