 * Edges added to a Graph. If an object is added to a graph and subsequently
 * removed from the Graph, then it is also deleted from the sets maintained by
 * the GraphAdditionMonitor. A GraphAdditionMonitor makes no effort to track the
 * removal of objects which were added to the graph before the
 * GraphAdditionMonitor was added as a GraphChangeListener to the Graph.
