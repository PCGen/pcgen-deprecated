#Every line that starts with a '#' is a comment. You may want to remove these comments, if you use this file to set up
#your own data. Remember not to put the '#' at the start of your own data, as PCGen would see it as a comment only.

#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Class File tags" to find
#out how the tags in the classes file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical
#listing of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.

#Class files are where each class is listed, given it's important information for the correct output and functioning of the
#class. Each class has 2 components to it: The main class line and the class level line. The class line begins with CLASS
#and the class level line begins with a level # (0, 1, 2, etc).
#
#The CLASS tag tells PCGen the class name and sets up the relationships with skills and spells. This line can be entered
#multiple times in a single class entry (appearing on separate lines) for purposes of making the lines easier to read in an
#editor (so as to not have to scroll forever to reach the end of the class line). THIS MUST BE THE FIRST TAG!!!
#
#The HD tag sets the Hit Die used to determine hit points at each level gained.
#
#The TYPE tag is used within the filters of PCGen to sort the classes by their respective types (makes it easier to find a
#specific class).
#
#The ABB tag can be used to hold a 3-5 letter abbreviation of the class name.
#
#The MAXLEVEL tag sets the maximum number of levels of the class you can add to a character. You can use MAXLEVEL:NOLIMIT in addition to a number. 
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the class. This will be displayed in PCGen.
#
#The LANGAUTO tag is holding a list of languages that the character automatically gains.
#
#The BONUS tags are a group of similar tags, that grant some form of Bonus to another already existing tag. To read a description
#of them, look in the List File Tag Index under the topic "Bonus tags".
#
#The STARTSKILLPTS tag determines how many skill points a character gains per level.
#
#The CSKILL tag grants the listed skills as class skills. When used in a classes.lst, it grants the class skills only to the
#class it is actually in.
#
#The FEATAUTO tag holds a list of feats that the class automatically gets.
#
#The SA tag is holding a text that will be displayed as Special Ability on the output sheet.
#
#The ADD:FEAT tag will give the character a choice of one from the feats listed in the parentheses. If the feat being added
#has a chooser ADD:FEAT is the only tag which will activate it (VFEAT, MFEAT and FEATAUTO will not). Besides of ADD:FEAT, there
#is a multitude of ADD tags in PCGen. You can look them up in the List File Tag Index under the topic "ADD Tags".
