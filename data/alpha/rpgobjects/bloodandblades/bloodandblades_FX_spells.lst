#Original entry by: Frank Kliewe

###As soon as I include the powers from rsrd_powers_psionic.lst fron the RSRD, the Polymorph.MOD ceases the function, I have
#therefore commented it out and put Polymorph (Self Only) in as a full new spell entry. This is just a variation/limitation
#of the Polymorph spell from MSRD Arcana.
