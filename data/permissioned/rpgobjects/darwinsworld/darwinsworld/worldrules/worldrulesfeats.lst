# Feel For Weapon - +2 only applies to a specific weapon OWNED by the character; another of the same type would not suffice
# Gladiator - -2 to opponents AC when they're wearing medium or heavy armor
# Improved Hit Dice does not check to see if already maxed at d12; also if user clicks HP button
# Improved Hit Dice: if user clicks HP button and Okay button, increase will disappear if roll was higher than base die
# Primitive Craft Class Skill: Used to allow Primitive Guardians and Traders to select a Craft Skill (any) to be a class skill.
# Primitive Craft Skill Bonus: Used to allow Primitive Scavs and Thinkers to select +2 Bonus to Craft (any), which are already class skills.
# Primitive Raider Craft Class Skill: Used to allow a Primitive Raider to select a Craft Skill (not Mechanics - which is already a class skill) to be a class skill.
# Primitive Raider Mechanics Bonus: Used to allow a Primitive Raider to select +2 Bonus to Craft (Mechanics), which is already a class skill.
# Rip A Clip: Can be taken twice; second time works as Great Cleave
# Secret Lore: Supposed to make Exclusive Skills Cross-Class for Thinker.  Set Animal Empathy and Read Lips as CCSKILL.
# WORKAROUNDS: Primitive Craft Class Skill, Primitive Craft Skill Bonus, Primitive Raider Craft Class Skill, Primitive Raider Mechanics Bonus, Greater Rip A Clip, Secret Lore, Skill Focus Advanced
