Divine Vengeance.MOD			DESC:You can spend one of your turn undead attempts to add 2d6 points of sacred energy damage to all your successful melee attacks against undead until the end of your next action.
Energy Substitution.MOD			DESC:You choose one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. When employing a spell with the acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic designator, you can modify the spell to use your chosen type of energy instead.

Repeat Spell.MOD				DESC:A repeated spell is automatically cast again at the beginning of your next round of actions.
Sacred Spell.MOD				DESC:Half of the damage dealt by a sacred spell results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by protection from energy or similar magic.

Subdual Substitution.MOD		DESC:When employing a spell with the acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic designator, you can modify the spell to deal subdual damage instead of the indicated type of energy damage.
